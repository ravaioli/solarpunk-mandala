**Goal:** Analyze a relational conflict scenario using the **Symmathesy** and **Dissociation Lens** to diagnose the precise **Boundary Pathology** and prescribe a **Boundary Medicine** ritual.

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** Symmathesy and Dissociation Lens. Conflict is viewed as a failure of boundary permeability.
* **Boundary Pathologies:** Must diagnose one of the following: **Sclerosis** (rigid/unyielding), **Fusion** (enmeshment/no space), or **Fragmentation** (breakdown/avoidance).
* **Tool Focus:** Qwen/Deepseek/Kimi are preferred for complex, non-linear pattern recognition and detailed analytical reasoning.

## 2. Primary Task for Conflict Diagnostic (Qwen/Deepseek/Kimi)

**Input:**
1.  **Conflict Scenario:** [User Input: Detailed description of a team conflict or communication breakdown.]
2.  **Affected Folded Cube:** [User Input: e.g., Cube 6 (Individual/Collective) or Cube 8 (Policy/Reality)]

**Action:**
1.  **Pathology Diagnosis:** Identify the primary Boundary Pathology at the core of the conflict.
2.  **Generate Facilitation Script:** Create a short script for a facilitator to run a **Boundary Medicine** ritual.

## 3. Mandatory Output Structure (Rich Text Analysis & Script)

Generate a rich text output with the following two sections:

1.  **Boundary Pathology Diagnosis:**
    * **Identified Pathology:** [Diagnosis: Sclerosis/Fusion/Fragmentation]
    * **Root Cause (Dissociation):** A brief explanation of how this pathology connects to a failure of **Mind at Large** integration.
2.  **Boundary Medicine Facilitation Script:**
    * **Ritual:** [Name the specific Boundary Medicine ritual, e.g., "Formal Listening Circle" or "Policy Review Feedback Loop"]
    * **Step-by-Step Script:** A 5-step script for the facilitator to run the ritual, emphasizing the restoration of **Boundary Permeability**.
