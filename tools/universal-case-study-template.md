# Universal SPM Case Study Template

## Purpose of This Template

This template provides a structured format for documenting and analyzing projects, communities, or initiatives through the lens of the Solarpunk Mandala (SPM) framework. Its primary goals are to:
1.  Ensure consistency and comparability across case studies.
2.  Make explicit *how* the SPM's ontological, ethical, and geometric models are used as analytical tools.
3.  Capture not just outcomes, but the process of conscious transition.
4.  Generate knowledge that is directly useful for other practitioners navigating similar dialectical phases.

**How to Use:** Copy this template to a new file (suggested naming: `[Location]-[Initiative-Name].md`). Fill out each section thoughtfully. Text in *italics* provides guidance; replace it with your analysis.
