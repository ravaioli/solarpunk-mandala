# Universal SPM Case Study Template

## Purpose of This Template

This template provides a structured format for documenting and analyzing projects, communities, or initiatives through the lens of the Solarpunk Mandala (SPM) framework. Its primary goals are to:
1.  Ensure consistency and comparability across case studies.
2.  Make explicit *how* the SPM's ontological, ethical, and geometric models are used as analytical tools.
3.  Capture not just outcomes, but the process of conscious transition.
4.  Generate knowledge that is directly useful for other practitioners navigating similar dialectical phases.

**How to Use:** Copy this template to a new file (suggested naming: `[Location]-[Initiative-Name].md`). Fill out each section thoughtfully. Text in *italics* provides guidance; replace it with your analysis.

# [Case Study Name]: [Concise, Evocative Tagline]

## 0. SPM Research Methodology & Lens
*This is the most critical section. It defines your analytical standpoint and how you applied the SPM as a research framework, not just a descriptive checklist.*

- **Analytical Idealism Perspective:**
  *How is the subject understood as a manifestation of collective consciousness? What "mind-at-large" patterns is it attempting to instantiate? (e.g., "This ecovillage is analyzed as a collective materialization of the intention to embody human-nature symbiosis.")*

- **Systems Cybernetics & Feedback Loops Identified:**
  *What are the key reinforcing or balancing loops in the system? How does the initiative design or interact with these loops? (e.g., "The community currency is analyzed as a critical feedback mechanism designed to increase local economic circulation and resilience, creating a balancing loop against extractive capital flows.")*

- **Primary Dialectical Phase:**
  *[ ] 0D - Dissolution / Foundation | [ ] 1D - Emergence / Differentiation | [ ] 2D - Integration / Interaction | [ ] 3D+ - Transformation / Metasystem*
  *Justify your choice based on the system's complexity, stability, and self-awareness.*

- **Ethical Axes Evaluation (Brief Notes):**
  - **Unitive (Connective):** *Does it build bridges/reduce alienation?*
  - **Beautiful (Enlivening):** *Does it generate harmony, elegance, uplift?*
  - **Just (Equitable):** *Does it distribute power, access, and agency fairly?*
  - **True (Coherent):** *Does it align with reality and systemic logic?*

- **Core Geometric Model(s) Applied:**
  *Which SPM geometric frameworks were used to understand structure? (e.g., "The Tesseract was used to map the initiative's development across four spatial and temporal dimensions. Hexagonal mapping identified key connection nodes in the social network.")*

## 1. Context & Initiative Profile

- **Location:** *Geographic and bioregional context.*
- **Initiative Name:**
- **Year(s) of Observation/Study:**
- **Core Catalyzing Challenge(s):** *The key problems, crises, or limitations that spurred the initiative (e.g., climate disaster, economic collapse, social alienation, ecological degradation).*
- **Brief Description:** *(2-3 sentences providing a clear overview.)*

## 2. Arena Framework in Action
*Map the initiative onto the core SPM operational frameworks.*

- **Ekistics Focus:** *Primary layers of human settlement engaged (e.g., NATURE, MAN, SOCIETY, SHELLS, NETWORKS).*
- **Circles Dynamics:** *Primary domains of activity activated (POLITICS, ECONOMICS, CULTURE, ECOLOGY, SPIRITUALITY). Note which were strongest/weakest.*
- **Pathways Activated:** *Healing (Cura), Making (Capacitação), Liberation (Liberação), Awakening (Conscientização).*
- **Key SPM Protocols/Tools Applied:** *Reference specific tools from the `/tools/` directory if used (e.g., `symmathesy-conflict-diagnostic`, `foundation-first-aid-script`, the `Regenerative Capital Dashboard`).*

## 3. Implementation Narrative
*Describe the key actions, processes, decision-points, and turning points. Focus on the "how." This is the story of the transition. Use subheadings if helpful (e.g., "Seed Phase (0D)", "The First Ritual of Diagnosis", "Navigating a Crisis").*

## 4. Outcomes & Measurable Effects
*Document changes with qualitative and quantitative data where possible.*

- **Systemic Changes:** *Shifts in governance, economic patterns, ecological health, or social norms.*
- **Regenerative Capital Metrics:** *If applicable, note observed changes in specific capitals from the Dashboard framework (e.g., "Relational Capital saw a marked increase post-conflict ritual," "Convivial Capital remained stubbornly low.").*
- **Alpha (α) Coefficient Trend:** *If the community uses the Dashboard, note the α trend over the project's timeline and its interpretation.*
- **Tangible Outputs:** *Physical infrastructure built, policies changed, hectares restored, etc.*

## 5. Critical Analysis & SPM Insights
*This is the synthesis—what does this case teach us about the framework and the process of regeneration?*

- **Key Learning:** *The core, transferable insight for other practitioners.*
- **Tessera Connection:** *How did this project reveal a "missing piece" or contribute a new pattern to the larger Mandala?*
- **Boundary Pathology/Medicine Observed:** *Were there issues of Sclerosis (rigidity), Fusion (enmeshment), or Fragmentation (disconnection)? What "Boundary Medicine" rituals or practices were effective?*
- **Dialectical Tensions Navigated:** *What key contradictions arose (e.g., individual vs. collective, short-term survival vs. long-term vision, structure vs. emergence)? How were they held or transcended?*
- **Limitations & Blind Spots:** *Where did the initiative or your analysis fall short? What would a "3D+" view reveal that a "1D" view might miss?*
