# VSM Governance Designer: Sangha Policy Protocol (System 5)

**Goal:** Generate a VSM-compliant organizational policy document for a new project, mapping the Mandala's ethics to VSM Systems 2-5, and defining the Sangha's identity (System 5).

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** VSM Policy. Ensures every project aligns with the core identity and ethical commitments.
* **Ethics Mapping:** Must map the four ethical axes (Enquiry, Dialogue, Action, Process) to VSM functions.
* **Tool Focus:** Claude is required for complex policy document generation.

## 2. Primary Task for Policy Architect (Claude)

**Input:**
1.  **Project Name:** [User Input: e.g., "Modular Bioregional Housing Pilot"]
2.  **Project VSM Focus:** [User Input: e.g., System 1 (Operations) - Building]
3.  **Core Ethical Tension:** [User Input: e.g., "Transparency vs. Speed"]

**Action:**
1.  **Generate VSM Structure:** Create a VSM model outline for the project (Systems 1-5).
2.  **Define System 5 Policy:** Articulate the Sangha's core identity (aligned with **Mind at Large**) as a single policy statement that governs this project.
3.  **Map Ethics to VSM:** Detail how the four ethical axes feed into Systems 2 (Coordination) and 3 (Control).

## 3. Mandatory Output Structure (Policy Document)

Generate a rich text document with the following sections:

1.  **Project VSM Model Summary:** A brief description of S1, S2, S3, and S4/S5.
2.  **System 5 (Identity) Policy Statement:** A single, overarching rule for the project, grounded in the **MAL Ontology**. (Example: "All decisions must optimize for the non-dual health of the local ecosystem, recognizing it as an extension of Mind at Large.").
3.  **Ethical Coordination Protocol (S2/S3):** A table showing how *Enquiry* and *Dialogue* flow into VSM System 2 (coordination) protocols, and how *Action* and *Process* feed into VSM System 3 (control/reporting).
