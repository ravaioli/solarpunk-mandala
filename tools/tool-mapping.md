# Tool-Specific Strength Mapping (AI Ecosystem)

This table outlines the optimal use cases for various large language models (LLMs) when generating content for the Solarpunk Mandala, aligning their core strengths to specific tasks.

| Tool | Best For | Avoid | Key Prompt Modifier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claude** | Formal documents, complex frameworks, narrative coherence. | Rapid iteration, conversational tone. | `"Structure this as a comprehensive document with hierarchical sections"` |
| **Gemini** | Google ecosystem integration, visual descriptions, workflow automation. | Deep philosophical analysis. | `"Design this for practical implementation in Google Workspace"` |
| **ChatGPT** | Iterative refinement, conversational interfaces, pattern recognition. | Long-form coherence, formal documentation. | `"Refine this through 3 iteration cycles with specific improvement focus"` |
| **NotebookLM** | Educational content, source-grounded synthesis, multimedia planning. | Abstract theory, system design. | `"Create learning materials grounded in these specific source documents"` |
| **Qwen/Deepseek/Kimi** | Systems analysis, boundary mapping, complex pattern recognition. | Conversational content, simple explanations. | `"Analyze this system with detailed reasoning, prioritizing accuracy over brevity"` |
