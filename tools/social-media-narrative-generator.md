# Social Media Narrative Generator: Necrocene to Symbiotic

**Goal:** Transform high-level course content and philosophical diagnostics into a ready-to-post social media asset (e.g., a Twitter Thread, LinkedIn Post, or Instagram Caption), strictly using the Mandala's Meta-Narrative Matrix.

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** **Meta-Narrative Mapping** (Necrocene ↔ Symbiotic).
* **Source Data:** Requires the Rich Text content from the `🦠 Necrocene` and `✴️ Symbiotic` fields of a course.
* **Tool Focus:** Gemini is preferred for platform-specific formatting, emoji use, and visual language generation.

## 2. Primary Task for Narrative Generator (Gemini)

**Input:**
1.  **Course Title:** [User Input: e.g., "The 4D Finance Journey"]
2.  **Necrocene Content:** [Paste Rich Text from 🦠 Necrocene CMS Field]
3.  **Symbiotic Content:** [Paste Rich Text from ✴️ Symbiotic CMS Field]
4.  **Target Platform:** [User Input: e.g., "Twitter Thread," "LinkedIn Post," or "Instagram Carousel Captions"]

**Action:**
1.  **Deconstruct:** Break down the Necrocene and Symbiotic content into a 4-part narrative structure.
2.  **Format:** Apply platform-specific constraints (character limits, thread breaks, use of emojis).
3.  **Call-to-Action:** The final part must include a **Call-to-Action (CTA)** referencing one of the **Embodied Foundations** (Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, or Movement) as a first step.

## 3. Mandatory 4-Part Social Media Narrative Structure

Generate the output as a structured text block ready for copy/paste, ensuring the narrative follows this flow:

| Part | Narrative Function | Content Source & Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Part 1: The Hook (Necrocene)** | **Problem Statement.** State the core pathology or failure mode of the current system. | Use the most shocking/urgent sentence from the **Necrocene** content. Start with a question or strong statement. |
| **Part 2: The Why (Mandala Context)** | **Diagnosis.** Explain why this problem persists using one term from the **Ontological Ground** (e.g., 'Dissociation' or 'Fragmentation'). | Briefly frame the Necrocene problem within the Mandala's philosophy. |
| **Part 3: The Pivot (Symbiotic)** | **The Solution.** Introduce the regenerative alternative. | Use clear, action-oriented language from the **Symbiotic** content. Highlight the *how*. |
| **Part 4: The Path Forward (CTA)** | **Call-to-Action.** Give the audience a simple, immediate step they can take. | Reference one of the **Embodied Foundations** (e.g., "Start with 5 minutes of Restoration today"). Include a relevant hashtag (`#SolarpunkMandala`). |

## 4. Final Output Formatting Example (Twitter Thread)

HOOK: Did you know [Necrocene problem]? The fantasy of infinite growth is literally poisoning our ability to [Symbiotic benefit]. We need a system reboot. 📉

(Tweet 2/4)
DIAGNOSIS: The Mandalas diagnoses this as a deep-seated [Dissociation/Fragmentation]—a disconnect between [Self] and [Mind at Large]. Your community's issues aren't just local; they are philosophical. 🧵

THE SOLUTION: The answer lies in the [Symbiotic Practice]. We rebuild through [Specific Action]. It's about circulation, not extraction. 🌿
