# Rhizome Project Scaffolding Planner

**Goal:** Transform a raw project idea into a viable community project by identifying the necessary **Rhizome** (community) type, mapping the initial **Folded Cube** challenge, and generating a coordination plan.

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** **Rhizomes** (Community Archetypes) and **Folded Cubes** (Relational Challenges).
* **Coordination Focus:** The output must be directly actionable by **VSM System 2 (Coordination)**.
* **Tool Focus:** Claude is preferred for synthesizing complex relationships between the project idea and the Sangha's existing taxonomy.

## 2. Primary Task for Scaffolding Planner (Claude)

**Input:**
1.  **Raw Project Idea:** [User Input: e.g., "Start a community-owned tool library."]
2.  **Geographic Context:** [User Input: e.g., "Suburban environment with high retiree population."]

**Action:**
1.  **Rhizome Mapping:** Identify the top 2-3 **Rhizome** types (e.g., Civil Society, Social Spirituality, Good Health) most essential for the project's success.
2.  **Challenge Mapping:** Identify the most likely initial **Folded Cube** challenge (e.g., Cube 6: Individual/Collective) that will cause the first breakdown.
3.  **Generate Protocol:** Create a brief System 2 coordination protocol to address that challenge.

## 3. Mandatory Output Structure (Structured Rich Text)

Generate a rich text output suitable for an internal ClickUp document:

1.  **Project Viability Summary:** (1-2 sentences)
2.  **Rhizome Requirement Analysis:** A list of the 2-3 essential Rhizome types and why they are needed.
3.  **Initial Folded Cube Challenge:** [State the Cube number and the potential relational boundary pathology.]
4.  **VSM System 2 Coordination Protocol:** A 3-step action plan to address the Folded Cube challenge immediately upon launch.
