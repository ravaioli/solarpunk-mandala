# Necrocene Decoupling Protocol: 5-Step Transition Plan

**Goal:** Generate a concrete, 5-step action plan for a collective or individual to divest from a specified **Necrocene Mechanism** and shift resources into a **Symbiotic Alternative**.

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** **Praxis (Action)** and **Temporal Unfolding (4D Transformation)**. Must define a clear path from the problem (Necrocene) to the solution (Symbiotic).
* **Policy Focus:** Output must be actionable at the community/policy level.
* **Tool Focus:** Qwen/Deepseek/Kimi are preferred for deep policy analysis and identifying complex transition steps.

## 2. Primary Task for Protocol Architect (Qwen/Deepseek/Kimi)

**Input:**
1.  **Necrocene Mechanism:** [User Input: e.g., "The Global Fossil Fuel Energy Grid"]
2.  **Symbiotic Alternative:** [User Input: e.g., "Local Community-Owned Solar Microgrids"]
3.  **Target Stakeholder:** [User Input: e.g., "A Municipal Government" or "A Neighborhood Collective"]

**Action:**
1.  **Diagnosis:** Briefly define the core dissociation caused by the Necrocene Mechanism.
2.  **Generate Protocol:** Create the 5-step Decoupling Protocol, ensuring each step is a verifiable action.

## 3. Mandatory 5-Step Protocol Output Structure

Generate a rich text action plan with the following five sequential steps:

1.  **Step 1 (The Audit):** **Enquiry.** A mandatory knowledge-gathering and resource-mapping task.
2.  **Step 2 (The Boundary):** **Dialogue.** A policy or relational action to formally mark the separation from the Necrocene system (e.g., A formal declaration/vote).
3.  **Step 3 (The Anchor):** **Action.** The first physical/economic investment into the Symbiotic Alternative.
4.  **Step 4 (The Network):** **Process.** The necessary VSM System 2 coordination/infrastructure shift to ensure the alternative is viable.
5.  **Step 5 (The Integration):** **Mind at Large Reflection.** A question for the stakeholders on how the shift changed their relationship to the **Ontological Ground** (e.g., "How does this microgrid make our collective identity more resilient?").
