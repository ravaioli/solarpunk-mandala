# Mandala Course Architect: 4D Curriculum Design

**Goal:** Design a comprehensive educational course syllabus that moves a learner from 0D (Survival) to 4D (Wholeness), strictly adhering to the Mandala's architecture, and generating content for the Webflow Course CMS.

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** Popular Education for the Eternal Now (co-created, experience-based learning).
* **Ontology Constraint:** All learning objectives must honor **Mind at Large (MAL)** integration.
* **Tool Focus:** NotebookLM must ground concepts in provided source documents (or strong academic analogues).

## 2. Primary Task for Course Architect (NotebookLM)

**Input:**
1.  **Course Topic:** [User Input: e.g., "Regenerative Community Finance"]
2.  **Target Pathway:** [User Input: Path A, B, or C]
3.  **Source Documents:** [NotebookLM Document Links/Titles]

**Action:**
1.  **Assign Pathway:** State which of the three **SolarPunk Sangha Educational Pathways** the course aligns with.
