# Foundation First Aid Script: Crisis Stabilization Protocol

**Goal:** Generate a 5-minute, high-urgency script for a crisis meeting, focused entirely on stabilizing a single Embodied Foundation (N, C, R, or M).

## 1. Universal AI Handoff Specification

[MANDALA CONTEXT]
* **Framework Version:** SolarPunk Mandala v3.0
* **Core Logic:** **Foundation First Aid** (0D Stabilization). Priority is immediate physical and psychological safety.
* **Action Focus:** Must contain a **Somatic Anchor** (physical action) and an **Immediate Policy Change** (a governance recommendation).
* **Tool Focus:** Gemini is preferred for clear, concise, and immediately actionable scriptwriting.

## 2. Primary Task for Crisis Script Writer (Gemini)

**Input:**
1.  **Crisis Foundation:** [User Input: The single foundation requiring immediate attention, e.g., "Restoration (Severe Burnout)"]
2.  **Team Context:** [User Input: Brief description of the team and their immediate stressor.]

**Action:**
1.  **Generate Script:** Write the full 5-minute crisis script using the three-part structure.
2.  **Generate Google Doc Embed:** Ensure the output is formatted as a single, clean block ready for copy/paste into a crisis communication Google Doc or Figma embed.

## 3. Mandatory 3-Part Crisis Script Structure

Generate the output as a verbatim script block with explicit time markers:

1.  **The Somatic Anchor (1 min):** A single physical/breathing exercise to stabilize the **Point Identity (0D)**.
2.  **The Crisis Reflection (2 min):** A brief, non-blaming statement connecting the crisis to the failure of the specific **Crisis Foundation** (e.g., "We have failed to honor our need for Restoration.").
3.  **Immediate Policy Change (2 min):** A single, clear, emergency governance recommendation (e.g., "All non-essential meetings are canceled for 48 hours. This is our emergency policy.").

## 4. Final Constraint

The output must include a final sentence referencing the need for a follow-up VSM Policy review (System 5) to prevent future crises.
