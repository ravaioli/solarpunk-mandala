# Solarpunk Mandala

A curated collection of theory, design patterns, tools, and prompts for building solarpunk-inspired mandalas — visual systems and assets grounded in regenerative principles.

Structure

- 02_foundations — domain-specific foundations and patterns
- 03_tools_prompts — executable snippets, tool mappings, and reusable prompts
- README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING — project-level docs
