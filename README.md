## 🌻 What is Solarpunk?

Solarpunk is a movement and aesthetic that envisions how the future might look if humanity solved major contemporary challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality. It's characterized by:

- **Renewable energy** and appropriate technology
- **Regenerative design** that heals ecosystems
- **Community-centered** governance and decision-making
- **Diversity and inclusion** as core values
- **Beauty and artistry** integrated into functional systems
- **Decentralized, resilient** infrastructure

The Solarpunk Mandala framework takes these principles and provides a practical, actionable structure for implementing them in real-world contexts.
