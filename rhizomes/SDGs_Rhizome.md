>
> In developing regions, 1.9 billion people, or 36 per cent, lived in extreme poverty in 1990. That number had declined to 836 million in 2015, or 12 per cent, and to 736 million, or 10% in 2019.
>
> About 1 in 10 developing country workers and their families live in extreme poverty, despite being employed.

>
> Women are over-represented among the poor, and are expected to bear the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts, particularly in terms of disproportionate unpaid care work.
>
> Economic losses of up to 4 per cent of GDP per year due to environmental degradation and climate change pose a major challenge.

>
> 66 million primary school-age children attend classes hungry across the developing world, with 23 million in Africa alone.
>
> Food security
>
> Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40 per cent of today’s global population. It is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households.
>
> 500 million small farms worldwide, most still rainfed, provide up to 80 per cent of food consumed in a large part of the developing world. Investing in smallholder women and men is an important way to increase food security and nutrition for the poorest, as well as food production for local and global markets.
>
> Since the 1900s, some 75 per cent of crop diversity has been lost from farmers’ fields. Better use of agricultural biodiversity can contribute to more nutritious diets, enhanced livelihoods for farming communities and more resilient and sustainable farming systems.
>
> If women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry in the world could be reduced by up to 150 million.
>
> 1.4 billion people have no access to electricity worldwide – most of whom live in rural areas of the developing world. Energy poverty in many regions is a fundamental barrier to reducing hunger and ensuring that the world can produce enough food to meet future demand.
