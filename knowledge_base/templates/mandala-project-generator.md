## 1.0 Generative Core: Purpose & Principles

### 1.1 Heart Purpose
*What is the fundamental "why" of this project? What specific wound of separation (dissociation) does it seek to heal?*

### 1.2 Guiding Star Vision
*Describe the tangible, lived reality this project aims to create in 5-10 years. What does success feel, look, and sound like?*

### 1.3 Core Principles
*List 3-5 immutable principles that will guide all decisions (e.g., "Subsidiarity," "Care over Control," "Radical Inclusion").*

---
## 2.0 Mandala Dimension Integration
*How does this project actively engage with and regenerate each of the five interconnected dimensions?*

### 2.1 🌿 Ecological Regeneration
- **Land & Species Relationship:** How does the project directly restore, protect, or harmonize with local ecosystems?
- **Metabolic Flows:** How are energy, water, waste, and materials sourced, used, and cycled in a closed-loop system?
- **Embodied Practice:** What regular activity grounds participants in direct ecological relationship?

### 2.2 👥 Social Regeneration
- **Governance Model:** What is the specific structure for decision-making? (Refer to the **Assembly → Council → Confederation** model).
- **Conflict & Care:** What protocols are used for restorative justice, conflict transformation, and mutual support?
- **Culture & Narrative:** What rituals, celebrations, and shared stories build collective identity and belonging?

### 2.3 💡 Technological Regeneration
- **Tools of Coordination:** What specific open-source, federated, or low-tech tools are used for communication, documentation, and resource mapping?
- **Tools of Production:** What appropriate technologies are used for creating, maintaining, and repairing needed goods?
- **Knowledge Commons:** How is knowledge (skills, designs, lessons learned) documented and shared freely?

### 2.4 🧠 Personal Regeneration
- **Skill Sovereignty Pathway:** What core competencies does the project help each member develop (e.g., facilitation, herbalism, conflict mediation)?
- **Inner Development Practice:** What shared or supported practices cultivate mindfulness, emotional resilience, and self-awareness?
- **Vocation & Contribution:** How does the project help individuals align their unique gifts with collective needs?

### 2.5 💰 Economic Regeneration
- **Resource Pooling Model:** How are key assets (land, capital, tools) held and managed (e.g., commons trust, cooperative)?
- **Exchange & Currency:** What mediums of exchange are used (e.g., time credits, mutual credit, local currency, gift)?
- **Provisioning & Resilience:** How does the project meet core needs (food, shelter, care) while reducing external dependencies?

## 3.0 Structural Architecture

### 3.1 Fractal Governance (Inspired by CNT Model)
| Level | Unit Name | Sovereign Function | Federative Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | Primary Assembly (e.g., Household, Crew) | Final decision-making on local matters | Sends recallable delegates to... |
| **Tier 1** | Neighborhood / Project Council | Coordinates between base assemblies | Sends recallable delegates to... |
| **Tier 2** | Bioregional / City Confederation | Manages regional infrastructure, solidarity | Links to wider networks |

### 3.2 Phased Temporal Unfolding
- **Phase 1: Germination** (Months 0-6): Core group formation, principle alignment, micro-pilot.
- **Phase 2: Rooting** (Years 1-2): Legal structure, foundational systems, first major project.
- **Phase 3: Branching** (Years 3-5): Scaling membership, federating, replicating models.
- **Phase 4: Flowering** (Years 5+): Solid cultural narrative, serving as a mentor node.

## 4.0 Integration & Resonance

### 4.1 Ontological Grounding
- **Dissociation Lens:** *"Which specific boundary (self/other, human/nature, thought/matter) does this project most directly aim to make porous or heal?"*
- **Material Intelligence:** *How do we relate to our physical assets and tools as "consciousness made visible," deserving of care and reverence?*

### 4.2 Rhizome Connections
*Which external frameworks does this project intentionally align with and embody?*
- [ ] UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Which specific targets?
- [ ] Principles of the Green New Deal
- [ ] Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- [ ] Doughnut Economics
- [ ] Other: _________________

## 5.0 Living Documentation & Metrics

### 5.1 Regenerative Metrics
*What are our key indicators of health for each dimension?*
- **Ecological:** [e.g., Soil organic matter %, native plant species count, water retained on-site]
- **Social:** [e.g., Participation rate in assemblies, diversity index, successful conflict resolutions]
- **Economic:** [e.g., % of basic needs met internally, hours logged in mutual credit system]

### 5.2 Protocol Library
*Link to the specific, living documents that detail our key processes:*
- `decision-making-protocol.md`
- `conflict-transformation-guide.md`
- `onboarding-and-skill-share.md`
