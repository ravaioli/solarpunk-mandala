# Knowledge Base Templates Index

This folder contains markdown files used as templates for creating new content within the Solarpunk Mandala knowledge base.

To use a template, copy the content into a new file and fill in the bracketed placeholder text (`[... ]`).

| Template File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Archetype_Template.md](./Archetype_Template.md) | Blueprint for documenting an individual Archetype's full narrative, history, and applications. |
| [Connection_Template.md](./Connection_Template.md) | Blueprint for documenting the complex, qualitative relationship between two specific Archetypes (the core "Mandala" connections). |
| [Procedural_Template.md](./Procedural_Template.md) | Step-by-step guide for common repository tasks (e.g., adding data, generating files). 
| [blog_post_cms_template.md](./blog_post_cms_template.md) | This template defines the exact field structure and expected content for a new blog post entry to be imported into the CMS. The final output must be machine-readable, ideally in CSV or structured JSON format.|
| [food_recipe_cms_template.md](./food_recipe_cms_template.md) | This template defines the exact field structure and expected content for a new food recipe entry to be imported into the CMS. The final output must be machine-readable, ideally in CSV or structured JSON format.|
