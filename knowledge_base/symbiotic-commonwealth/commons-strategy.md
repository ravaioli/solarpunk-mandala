# Commons Strategy

**Meta-Narrative**: ✴️ Symbiotic Commonwealth  
**Logic**: Operational Mechanisms  
**Category**: The Commons-Based Tools  
**Emoji**: ⛲

## Overview
Managing resources through community governance. Circulates wealth through shared stewardship—money as a commons, not a tool of extraction.

## Core Concepts
- **Citizen Assemblies**: Everyday people governing together
- **Cooperative Ownership**: Workers own their labor
- **Open Source Culture**: Knowledge shared, no monopolized
- **Ecosystem Services**: Inherent natural value

## Self-Enquiry
How could models like Cooperative Ownership and Citizen Assemblies be applied to solve a specific problem in my community, and how do we properly value the Ecosystem Services that support all life?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Do resources circulate or accumulate?
2. Are needs met through participation or possession?
3. Does ownership create stewards or hoarders?

## Related Variables
- Commons governance effectiveness
- Resource circulation velocity
- Wealth concentration trends

## Organ: The Circulatory System
**Capacity**: Equitable Flow

## Rationale
To ensure wealth and knowledge circulate as commonwealth, nourishing the entire community.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Community land trusts, mutual credit systems, and participatory budgeting.

## Defense/Propagation
**Commoning**: The social practice of collectively managing a resource, which inherently defends against privatization.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Circulatory Health: Resources flow through commons-based systems that prevent hoarding and ensure equitable distribution.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Resource Management
- **ENHANCES**: Equitable distribution; stewardship; circular flows; community governance
- **OBSOLESCES**: Private enclosure; state bureaucracy; resource hoarding
- **RETRIEVES**: Medieval/indigenous commons with modern institutional design
- **REVERSES INTO**: Commons becomes primary mode, rendering state/market models secondary

## Partial Diagnosis
Circulatory Health: Resources flow through commons-based systems that prevent hoarding and ensure equitable distribution.

## Case Study
Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre (1989-present): Brazil's pioneering participatory budgeting process demonstrates commons strategy through citizen assemblies that allocate municipal resources, cooperative ownership of decision-making processes, open source methodology adopted globally, and explicit attention to urban ecosystem services.

## Key Literature
**"Governing the Commons"** by Elinor Ostrom (1990): Ostrom's Nobel Prize-winning analysis of how communities successfully manage shared resources through institutional arrangements that avoid both market failures and government control.
