# Regenerative Temporality

**Meta-Narrative**: ✴️ Symbiotic Commonwealth  
**Logic**: Measured Outcomes  
**Category**: The Great Rhythm  
**Emoji**: 🌊

## Overview
Time is sacred, cyclical, and multi-generational as a medium for wisdom accumulation and the patient work of regeneration. Invests in deep time—circulating responsibility across generations through seven-generation thinking and ecological rhythms.

## Core Concepts
- **Seventh Generation Principle**: Governance considers impacts seven generations forward
- **Long-term Capital**: Communal investments mature over decades; wealth measured across generations
- **Intergenerational Dialogue**: Elders and youth co-create; cultural memory actively maintained
- **Ecological Time**: Decisions follow natural cycles and succession timelines

## Self-Enquiry
What can I do today that will make sense in 100 years? What legacy of healing can I contribute to?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Does the system become wiser and more resilient with time?
2. Are there mechanisms for knowledge and wisdom to accumulate across generations?
3. Does the system operate at nature's pace rather than technology's acceleration?

## Related Variables
- Multi-generational planning institutions
- Cultural continuity indices
- Ecological regeneration timelines

## Organ: The Womb of Time
**Capacity**: Long Now Consciousness

## Rationale
To make decisions that honor our ancestors and protect our descendants for seven generations.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Intergenerational dialogue, long-term institutions, and governance based on natural cycles.

## Defense/Propagation
**Temporal Sovereignty**: Defending the slow, patient work of regeneration against the demands of short-term extraction.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Temporal Abundance - Each moment contains all time; patience as power

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Time/The Future
- **ENHANCES**: Long-term thinking; intergenerational responsibility; patience; wisdom accumulation
- **OBSOLESCES**: Short-termism; emergency thinking; future discounting; cultural amnesia
