**Emoji**: 🧰

## Overview
Tools that enhance human agency and ecological wisdom. Empowers through open, repairable, community-controlled tools—circulating technological sovereignty and agency.

## Core Concepts
- **Digital Commons**: Our data, our shared resources
- **Open Source Hardware**: Repair, modify, understanding tools
- **Attention Sovereignty**: Control your own focus
- **Appropriate Scale**: Technology serving life

## Self-Enquiry
What does Attention Sovereignty mean to me, and how can I use or support Appropriate Technology and Open Source Hardware to reclaim it from corporate platforms?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Does technology increase autonomy or dependence?
2. Can tools be understood, modified, and repaired by users?
3. Does tech scale enhance or diminish life?

## Related Variables
- Technology accessibility and literacy
- Repair and modification rates
- Ecological impact of tech systems

## Organ: The Liberatory Tools
**Capacity**: Augmented Agency

## Rationale
To create tools that serve life, enhance understanding, and remain under community control.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Open-source hardware, digital commons, and design principles favoring repairability and appropriate scale.

## Defense/Propagation
**Sovereign Toolmaking**: The community's ability to understand, modify, and control its own technological means.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Symbiotic Tools: Technology serves life—digital commons protect data sovereignty, open hardware enables repair, scale matches ecological context.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Technology
- **ENHANCES**: Autonomy; understanding; repairability; ecological integration; human scale
- **OBSOLESCES**: Dependence; obscurity; planned obsolescence; ecological harm
- **RETRIEVES**: Craft traditions augmented with open-source and digital fabrication
- **REVERSES INTO**: Technology becomes seamlessly integrated into life without dominating it

## Partial Diagnosis
Symbiotic Tools: Technology serves life—digital commons protect data sovereignty, open hardware enables repair, scale matches ecological context.

## Case Study
FarmBot Open Source Farming Robot (2011-present): FarmBot demonstrates appropriate technology through open source hardware designs for precision agriculture, digital commons sharing of farming knowledge, attention sovereignty by reducing time spent on routine tasks, and appropriate scale technology accessible to home gardeners and small farms.

## Key Literature
**"Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered"** by E.F. Schumacher (1973): Schumacher's seminal work on intermediate technology emphasizes human-scale, environmentally sustainable, and locally adaptable technologies that serve community needs rather than maximizing profit or efficiency.
