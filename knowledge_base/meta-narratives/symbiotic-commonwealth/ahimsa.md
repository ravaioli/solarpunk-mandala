# Ahimsa

**Meta-Narrative**: ✴️ Symbiotic Commonwealth  
**Logic**: Foundational Logic  
**Category**: Ahimsic Intelligence  
**Emoji**: 🖖🏼

## Overview
Non-violence (ahimsa) is not passive but actively engineered into all systems—the positive presence of care rather than mere absence of harm. Designs systems where no one's well-being requires another's suffering—safety, health, and dignity as universal conditions.

## Core Concepts
- **Restorative Governance**: Conflict transformation that heals rather than punishes
- **Harm-Free Economics**: Systems designed so no one's prosperity requires another's deprivation
- **Cultural Reverence**: Active protection and celebration of diverse meaning systems
- **Ecological Reciprocity**: Human participation that enhances rather than depletes

## Self-Enquiry
How can I actively engineer non-violence into my relationships, work, and community participation?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Does the system have mechanisms for repairing harm when it occurs?
2. Are there feedback loops that prevent the externalization of costs?
3. Does the system become more non-violent through use?

**Capacity**: Non-Harm

## Rationale
To create a society where no one's prosperity requires another's deprivation.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Restorative justice, harm-free economics, and proactive conflict transformation.

## Defense/Propagation
**Active Compassion**: Responding to violence not with equal force, but with a greater force of understanding and healing.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Engineered Ahimsa - Non-violence as an active design principle, not just an ethical preference.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Conflict/Harm
- **ENHANCES**: Healing; reconciliation; trust; systemic care; proactive harm reduction
- **OBSOLESCES**: Punitive justice; retributive violence; cost externalization
- **RETRIEVES**: Ancient non-violence principles as active design in modern systems
- **REVERSES INTO**: Non-violence becomes the default condition, with violence seen as system design failure

## Partial Diagnosis
Engineered Ahimsa - Non-violence as an active design principle, not just an ethical preference.

## Case Study
Restorative Cities like Hull, UK implementing city-wide restorative approaches.
