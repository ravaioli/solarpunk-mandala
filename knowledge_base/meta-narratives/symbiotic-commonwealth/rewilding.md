**Meta-Narrative**: ✴️ Symbiotic Commonwealth  
**Logic**: Systemic Expressions  
**Category**: The Liberation Process

## Overview
Restoring agency and diversity at all levels. Restores autonomy by rebuilding self-organizing capacity—circulating control back to communities and ecosystems.

## Core Concepts
- **Community Autonomy**: Self-governance
- **Commons-based Production**: Shared stewardship
- **Holistic Identity**: Integrated being
- **Biodiversity**: Full ecological expression

## Self-Enquiry
What skills or resources could I contribute to a system of Commons-based Production that would increase my community's Community Autonomy, and how would this help me develop a more Holistic Identity beyond being a consumer?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Do systems recover from shocks with increased capability?
2. Does diversity increase during stress?
3. Are there multiple pathways for essential functions?

## Related Variables
- Community resilience to crises
- Innovation rate during challenges
- Redundancy and diversity metrics

## Organ: The Sovereign Spine
**Capacity**: Self-Organization

## Rationale
To build antifragile systems that gain strength from disturbance through distributed intelligence.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Returning land to wilderness, fostering community autonomy, and unlearning domestication.

## Defense/Propagation
**Feral Resilience**: The innate ability to self-organize, resist control, and regenerate from the bottom up.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Ecological Nervous System: Systems regain their self-organizing intelligence through distributed autonomy and biodiversity of approaches.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Agency/Diversity
- **ENHANCES**: Autonomy; self-organization; biodiversity; resilience; creativity
- **OBSOLESCES**: Control; standardization; monoculture; dependence
- **RETRIEVES**: Feral intelligence and wildness in context of human co-existence
- **REVERSES INTO**: System becomes antifragile—thriving on disturbance and change

## Partial Diagnosis
Ecological Nervous System: Systems regain their self-organizing intelligence through distributed autonomy and biodiversity of approaches.

## Case Study
Indigenous Forest Management in Pacific Northwest (ongoing): Traditional ecological knowledge of Coast Salish peoples demonstrates symbiotic ethos through controlled burning practices that increase biodiversity, salmon habitat restoration that benefits entire watersheds, and governance systems based on seven-generation thinking.

## Key Literature
**"Feral: Rewilding the Land, the Sea, and Human Life"** by George Monbiot (2013): Monbiot explores how rewilding landscapes and human communities can restore biodiversity and community autonomy, moving beyond mere conservation toward dynamic ecological and social regeneration.
