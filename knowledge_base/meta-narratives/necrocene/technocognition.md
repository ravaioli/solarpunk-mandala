## Overview
Using technology to shape thought and behavior at scale. Captures attention and data to manipulate behavior—hoarding technological sovereignty and cognitive autonomy.

## Core Concepts
- **Surveillance State**: Hidden observational control
- **Automated Extraction**: Machines mining value from life
- **Attention Algorithm**: Manufacturing addiction for profit
- **Techno-Utopia Escapism**: "Abandon Earth, no fix!"

## Self-Enquiry
Do the tools of the Surveillance State and Automated Extraction feel like an inevitable price for connection, or am I actively practicing Techno-Utopia Escapism to avoid confronting their corrosive effects on my Attention Algorithm and autonomy?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Does technology increase surveillance and control?
2. Are algorithms designed to manipulate behavior?
3. Is tech innovation focused on escapism over solution-making?

## Related Variables
- Screen time and addiction rates
- Data privacy breaches
- Tech solutionism vs. real-world impact

## Organ: The Eyes
**Capacity**: Attention & Perception

## Rationale
To control the narrative through high-tech surveillance and information warfare.

## Extraction/Cultivation
AI targeting systems; social media manipulation; killing journalists; controlling internet access.

## Defense/Propagation
**Convenience & Connection**: Framing digital control as necessary for security.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Cognitive Parasites: Technology is deployed to extract attention, data, and energy, creating addiction and escapism while avoiding real problems.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Human Attention
- **ENHANCES**: Behavioral manipulation; data extraction; personalized control; scale of influence
- **OBSOLESCES**: Privacy; autonomy; deep focus; independent judgment
- **RETRIEVES**: Village gossip and social surveillance at planetary scale
- **REVERSES INTO**: Cognitive fragmentation, attention deficit, and epistemic chaos

## Partial Diagnosis
Cognitive Parasites: Technology is deployed to extract attention, data, and energy, creating addiction and escapism while avoiding real problems.

## Case Study
TikTok Algorithm and Attention Extraction (2016-present): TikTok's "For You" page algorithm demonstrates technocognition through surveillance state data collection, automated extraction of attention and behavioral data, algorithmic manipulation of consciousness, and techno-utopian promises of creative expression masking exploitation.

## Key Literature
**"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"** by Shoshana Zuboff (2019): Zuboff's comprehensive analysis of how technology companies extract behavioral data for profit, creating new forms of surveillance and control while promising technological liberation.
