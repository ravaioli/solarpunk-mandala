## Core Concepts
- **Voting**: Controlled participation
- **Money**: Abstracted control
- **Education**: Ideological indoctrination
- **Biopower**: Control over life itself

## Self-Enquiry
When I use the primary Instruments of change—like Voting or Money—am I genuinely exerting influence, or am I mostly managing my compliance within a system of Biopower that governs life itself?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Do instruments of participation (e.g., voting) lead to real change?
2. Is education geared toward critical thinking or indoctrination?
3. Does biopower manage populations rather than enhance life?

## Case Study
Standardized Testing in Public Education (1990s-present): The proliferation of high-stakes testing demonstrates how educational instruments operate as biopower, sorting populations, disciplining both students and teachers, while creating market opportunities for testing companies.

## Key Literature
**"Discipline and Punish"** by Michel Foucault (1975): Foucault's analysis of how institutions shape subjects through disciplinary power, revealing how voting, education, and other instruments function as forms of biopower that create docile bodies.
