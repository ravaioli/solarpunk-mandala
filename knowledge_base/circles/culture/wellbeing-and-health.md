## Commons

A centralized, compassionate platform that serves as the community's shared system for supporting physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It integrates care, knowledge, and resources into a seamless web of support.

**Significance:** This Commons transforms health from a private, often isolating concern into a collective responsibility and resource. It is the vital tool for the `Mental Flourishing Gardener` to assess needs, the `Comfort-Networker` to mobilize support, and for every individual to find pathways to their own `Integrity and Autonomy`.

2. Pod Mobilization & "Care Circle" Formation: The Web of Well-being Pod activates
3. Resource Deployment & Sustained Support: The `Memory-Meal Chef` coordinates a meal train, the `Somatic Guide` offers trauma-informed body practices
4. Community-Wide "Holding": The pod communicates with the wider community to channel offers of help and maintain a container of collective care
