## Roles
**Settlement Pattern Designer** - Plans the overall layout of human habitation to concentrate it in the most resilient areas and preserve wild corridors.  
**15-Minute Community Designer** - Works to ensure all essential needs are within a short, pleasant walk or bike ride from every home, eliminating superfluous travel.  
**Mobility-as-a-Service Steward** - Runs and maintains free, efficient, and enjoyable public transit systems as a core utility of the commons.  
**Road Diet Advocate** - Works to reclaim space from private vehicles for greenways, bike lanes, and public space, managing shared community vehicles for necessary trips.  
**Pedestrian & Cycle Way Weaver** - Creates and maintains a beautiful, safe, and connected network of paths that make walking and cycling the default choice.  
**Inter-Community Logistics Coordinator** - Manages the minimal, efficient nodes for long-distance trade and travel with other bioregions, prioritizing sail and low-impact methods.

## Commons
**Living Habitat Commons**  
A dynamic, three-dimensional platform that serves as the collective memory and planning tool for the community's built environment and mobility systems. It treats the village/town as a living, adaptable organism.

**Significance:** This Commons makes the entire physical structure of the community a shared, intelligible, and malleable project. It is the essential tool for the Settlement Pattern Designer to plan layout, the Mobility-as-a-Service Steward to optimize transit, and the Pedestrian & Cycle Way Weaver to design human-scale pathways.

## Digital Platforms & Physical Hubs
**Digital Platform: "The Living Habitat Commons"**  
- Settlement Anatomy Maps: Interactive 3D maps showing orientation and spread, proximity and access to essential services, and the real-time flow of mass transit and public transport
- Mobility & Pathway Network Dashboard: Live system mapping all motorized transport and roads (minimized), non-motorized transport and walking paths (prioritized), and nodes for seaports and airports
- Adaptive Design Library: Open-source repository of blueprints, construction and building techniques, and retrofitting plans
- Habitat Impact Tracker: Monitors how the built environment affects topography and livability, original habitat and native vegetation, and microclimates

**Physical Hubs: "The Mobility & Design Nexus"**  
- The Transit Hub & Micromobility Depot: Central node for free mass transit with charging stations, bike parking, repair stations
- The Urban Planning & Design Studio: Collaborative workspace with physical and digital maps, 3D printers, public consultation spaces
- The Road Diet Demonstration Zone: Permanently transformed street section showcasing reclaimed space for bike lanes, greenways, public plazas

## Critical Protocol
**"Settlement Growth & Ecological Integration" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To govern the high-stakes process of deciding if and how the community should expand its physical footprint, preventing sprawl and habitat fragmentation.

**Process:**  
1. Trigger & Need Assessment: Question if need can be met by densifying existing space  
2. Deep Ecological Impact Assessment: Study impact on original habitat, water flows, wildlife corridors  
3. Multi-Generational Modeling: Visualize long-term effects on proximity, resource flows, ecosystem health  
4. Community-Wide Design Charrette: Collaborative workshop to co-create expansion plans  
5. Ratification with Ecological Covenants: Binding rules for habitat connectivity, water permeability, limits on motorized transport

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- Preliminary Need & Density Assessment Tool  
- Deep Ecological Impact Simulator  
- Community-Wide Design Charrette Facilitator's Kit  
- Ecological Covenants Builder

**Protocol Software:**  
- 15-Minute Accessibility Analyzer  
- Transit Equity & Efficiency Monitor  
- Shared Vehicle Management System

## Key Artifact
**"Annual State of Our Habitat" Report**  
A comprehensive and visually rich assessment of the community's success in building a living environment that serves both people and the planet.

**Contents:**  
- The Livability Index: Metrics on proximity and access, transit usage, miles of paths  
- Ecological Footprint of the Built-Form: Analysis of construction impacts on ecosystems  
- Mobility Justice Analysis: Data on equity of transport access across neighborhoods  
- Vibrant Space Stories: Case studies of redesigned streets and public squares

**Beauty:** This artifact tells the story of a community that sees its buildings and roads not as inert concrete, but as the very skeleton of its social and ecological life.

- Livability Index Calculator  
- Ecological Footprint Analyzer  
- Mobility Justice Analysis  
- Vibrant Space Story Curator
