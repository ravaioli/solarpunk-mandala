## Roles
**Community Health Ecologist** - Connects the dots between ecosystem health and human physical health, promoting activities that enhance both (e.g., wild food harvesting).  
**Lifecycle Educator** - Integrates understanding of ecological cycles of life, death, and decomposition into the community's understanding of its own human lifecycles.  
**Green Exercise Facilitator** - Organizes physical activities—like community gardening, trail building, and "walking meetings"—that are productive and connect people to nature.  
**Hygiene Systems Designer** - Designs and maintains human waste composting and greywater systems that safely return nutrients to the land without pollution.  
**Wild Food & Medicine Guide** - Educates the community on the identification, harvesting, and preparation of nutritious wild plants and fungi.  
**Agroecologist** - Practices and teaches farming that works with natural ecosystems, emphasizing polycultures, perennial crops, and soil health.

## Commons
**Vitality Commons**  
A community-wide platform dedicated to the holistic stewardship of the physical body and life-sustaining practices. It integrates data, knowledge, and resources to support the entire lifecycle of community members.

**Significance:** This Commons makes physical well-being a visible, collective responsibility rather than a private concern. It connects the Community Health Ecologist with vital data, helps the Lifecycle Educator coordinate resources, and enables the Green Exercise Facilitator to design community-appropriate activities.

## Critical Protocol
**"Community Metabolic Balance" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To address the high-stakes situation of a community-wide health or sustenance crisis (e.g., a crop failure, water contamination, or contagious illness outbreak).

**Process:**  
1. Emergency Assessment: Community Health Ecologist and Agroecologist assess crisis impacts on human health and ecosystem health
2. Resource Mobilization: Activate emergency plans for alternative nutrition sources and safe sanitation
3. Preventive Action Coordination: Organize safe outdoor activities while minimizing disease spread
4. Metabolic Monitoring: Implement enhanced monitoring of human health metrics and ecological indicators
5. Systemic Learning & Adaptation: Extract lessons and implement systemic changes to prevent future occurrences

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- Emergency Sustenance Response System: Protocol for mobilizing during health or sustenance crises
- Water & Energy Resilience Planner: Software modeling community usage against seasonal availability
- Lifecycle Nutrition Guide: Framework for ensuring optimal nutrition for all life stages
- Bioregional Food Calendar: Interactive calendar mapping seasonal availability of wild and cultivated foods

**Protocol Software:**  
- Soil-to-Gut Health Tracker: Correlates soil test data with nutritional density and community health metrics
- Human Nutrient Cycle Manager: Tool for modeling and managing safe composting of human waste
- Embodied Carbon Calculator: Tracks carbon footprint of community food and goods consumption

## Key Artifact
**"Annual Body of the Community" Report**  
A comprehensive assessment that measures the physical flourishing of the community as an integrated biological and ecological system.

**Contents:**  
- Vitality Index: Metrics tracking community-wide physical health, reproduction patterns, fitness levels, and nutritional status
- Metabolic Balance Analysis: Data on relationship between community consumption and local production
- Lifecycle Dignity Assessment: Evaluation of community support through all life stages
- Embodied Wisdom Stories: Examples of how traditional and new knowledge about bodies, hygiene, and exercise is preserved and evolved

**Beauty:** This artifact celebrates the community as a living, breathing entity that understands its fundamental connection to the land that sustains it. It represents a community that honors the physical journey of each member while maintaining the health of the larger whole.

**Generation Systems:**  
- Vitality Index Generator: Composite metric from data on community-wide physical health
- Metabolic Balance Analysis: Visualizes relationship between consumption and local production
- Lifecycle Dignity Assessment: Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of community support through life stages
- Embodied Wisdom Stories: Curated collection of narratives showcasing traditional and new knowledge
