## Commons

- **Commons Significance:** This Commons transforms security from a specialized, opaque function into a transparent, collective responsibility. It is the vital resource for the Crisis Response Coordinator to mobilize aid, the Sanctuary Keeper to manage space, and the De-escalation Guardian to understand community context. It ensures that safety is a commonly generated condition, not a service provided.
