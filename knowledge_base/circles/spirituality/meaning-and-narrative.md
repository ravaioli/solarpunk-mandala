- **Commons Significance:** This Commons is the community's collective consciousness—the place where they answer the question "Who are we and what is our story?" It provides the Meaning & Narrative Weaver with material for their work, gives the Vocation Sounding Board examples to draw from, and ensures the community's Legacy and Impact is consciously shaped.
