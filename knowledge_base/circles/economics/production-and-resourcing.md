## Roles
**Community Resilience Steward** - Cultivates robust, diverse, and adaptive local economies focused on well-being and stability, enabling the community to recover from and adapt to disruptions.  
**Circular Fabricator** - Operates small-scale, ethical workshops for producing durable goods, prioritizing repair, reuse, and recycling in a closed-loop system.  
**Ecological Harvest Guardian** - Manages the sustainable and respectful drawing of resources from nature, ensuring regenerative practices and preventing depletion.  
**Community Artisan** - Creates objects of beauty and daily use that embed cultural meaning, strengthen local identity, and are made to last for generations.  
**Open-Source Solutions Designer** - Develops appropriate, robust, and liberating technologies; all designs are shared as a common resource for all to use and adapt.  
**Capacity & Commons Coordinator** - Matches community members' skills and passions with projects, while maintaining shared tools, spaces, and resource libraries.

## Commons
**Regenerative Resource Ledger & Design Commons**  
A dynamic, open-source platform that serves as the collective brain and memory for the community's material metabolism. It maps the entire lifecycle of resources, from source to reuse.

**Significance:** This Commons is the antidote to the opaque, extractive supply chains of capitalism. It makes the entire material footprint of the community visible and manageable. It is essential for the `Ecological Harvest Guardian` to set sustainable yields, the `Circular Fabricator` to source materials, and the `Open-Source Solutions Designer` to share innovations. It turns production from a private, profit-driven activity into a public, ecologically-regulated process.

- Capacity Coordination Set: Skills assessment tools, project matching systems, resource scheduling

## Critical Protocol
**"New Resource & Production Proposal" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To govern the high-stakes decision of whether to introduce a new material, technology, or production process into the community. This is the primary gatekeeping mechanism against "enshittification" and ecological harm, preventing well-intentioned but damaging innovations from destabilizing the system.

**Process:**  
1. Comprehensive Impact Submission: Any proposal for a new resource use or product must be submitted to the Commons, including a full lifecycle analysis, its inputs/outputs, and its planned end-of-life pathway.
2. Multi-Domain Review: The Material Metabolism Pod facilitates a review period where pods from other domains assess the proposal. The **Ecology Pod** reviews environmental impact, the **Culture Pod** assesses social and aesthetic fit, and the **Ethical Culture Pod** scrutinizes its alignment with community values.
3. Community-Wide Deliberation: The `Open-Source Solutions Designer` and `Community Resilience Steward` present the proposal and the review feedback in a public assembly, facilitating a discussion focused on long-term impacts (`Planning and Vision`).
4. Provisional Consent with Sunset Clause: Approved proposals are granted provisional consent for a limited trial period. The `Ecological Harvest Guardian` and `Circular Fabricator` establish clear metrics for success and environmental monitoring.
5. Ratification or Sunset Review: At the end of the trial, the proposal is revisited. If it has met its goals without negative consequences, it is fully ratified. If not, it is sunsetted, and the `Capacity & Commons Coordinator` integrates the lessons learned into the community's knowledge base.

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- "New Resource & Production Proposal" Protocol Suite: Lifecycle impact assessment tool, multi-domain review platform, community deliberation facilitator, provisional consent manager, sunset review system
- Production Optimization Toolkit: Metabolic rift analyzer, circularity metrics calculator, resource sovereignty assessment, innovation-tradition integrator

## Key Artifact
**"State of Our Metabolism" Report**  
An annual, quantitative and qualitative audit that measures the community's success in moving from a linear, extractive economy to a circular, regenerative one.

**Contents:**  
- The Metabolic Rift Index: A measure of the gap between what the community consumes and what the local ecology can regeneratively provide.
- Circularity Metrics: Data on the percentage of materials sourced from reuse/recycling vs. virgin extraction, the average lifespan of products, and repair rates.
- Innovation & Tradition Spotlight: Features on a successful `Open-Source Solution` and a cherished `Art and Craft` tradition, exploring their symbiotic relationship.
- Resource Sovereignty Assessment: An analysis of the community's resilience by tracking its self-sufficiency in critical areas (food, energy, water, materials) and the health of its trade relationships.

**Beauty:** This artifact is beautiful because it tells the story of a community learning to live as a part of nature, not apart from it. It redefines "prosperity" not as the accumulation of goods, but as the flourishing of a well-managed, creative, and reciprocal relationship with the material world. It is a testament to a society that produces not for profit, but for life.
