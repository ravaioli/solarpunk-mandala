## Roles
**Appropriate Tech Evaluator** - Assesses technologies for their durability, repairability, accessibility, and alignment with ecological and social values.  
**Decentralized Network Gardener** - Maintains resilient, open-source communication infrastructures that are free from corporate or state control.  
**Mobility Systems Steward** - Plans and maintains multi-modal transit (walking, biking, public transport) that is free/low-cost and minimizes ecological impact.  
**Ecological Builder** - Constructs and retrofits housing and public buildings using natural, local, and non-toxic materials in ways that integrate with the ecosystem.  
**Popular Educator** - Facilitates lifelong learning that is free and integrated with social life, focusing on critical thinking, cooperation, and practical skills.  
**Community Health Worker** - Provides frontline, holistic healthcare and promotes public health, focusing on prevention and community-wide well-being.

## Commons
**Liberatory Technology Stack & Infrastructure Commons**  
A unified, open-source repository and management system for all the community's foundational technologies and infrastructures. It treats these systems as public utilities to be stewarded for the common good, not owned for profit.

**Significance:** This Commons prevents technological enshittification, vendor lock-in, and planned obsolescence. It ensures technology serves the community, not the reverse.

## Digital Platforms & Physical Hubs
**Digital Platform: "The Symbiotic Stack"**  
- Decentralized Digital Commons: Federated network of community-owned servers with distributed storage and computing
- Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard: Real-time tracking of energy grids, water systems, communications networks, and transportation flows
- Open Source Tool Library: Curated repository of liberating technologies with deployment guides and maintenance protocols
- Appropriate Technology Selector: Decision-making framework for choosing technologies based on ecological impact and community benefit

**Physical Hubs: "The Techno-Ecological Center"**  
- Network Operations Hub: Secure space for maintaining community internet and communication systems
- Renewable Energy Control Room: Monitoring and management of decentralized energy grids
- Open Source Fabrication Lab: Makerspace with 3D printers, CNC machines, and electronics workstations
- Appropriate Technology Workshop: Space for developing and maintaining low-tech solutions
- Infrastructure Testing Grounds: Outdoor area for piloting new systems and technologies

## Core Pod
**Infrastructure Stewards Pod**  
**Mandate:** To ensure the community's technological and infrastructural systems are resilient, liberating, accessible, and aligned with ecological and social values. They are the guardians and gardeners of the built and digital environment.

**Composition:**  
- Appropriate Tech Evaluator (Appropriateness and Robustness)  
- Decentralized Network Gardener (Communications and Information)  
- Mobility Systems Steward (Transport and Movement)  
- Ecological Builder (Construction and Building)  
- Popular Educator (Education and Training)  
- Community Health Worker (Medicine and Health Treatment)

**Pod-Specific Workspaces:**  
- System Integration Dashboard: Real-time monitoring of all interconnected infrastructure
- Maintenance Coordination Platform: Schedules and tracks upkeep across all systems
- Technology Assessment Hub: Central repository for technology evaluations and decisions
- Digital Sovereignty Tools: Systems for protecting community data and network independence

**Pod Resource Kit:**  
- Network Deployment Kit: Mesh networking equipment, setup tools, troubleshooting guides
- Renewable Energy Maintenance Pack: Solar panel repair tools, battery testing equipment, grid monitoring devices
- Open Source Fabrication Toolkit: 3D printing materials, electronics components, repair manuals
- Infrastructure Assessment Kit: Testing equipment, measurement tools, safety gear
- Digital Literacy Resources: Training materials, accessible technology guides, privacy tools

## Critical Protocol
**"Technology Adoption & Impact" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To govern the high-stakes process of adopting any new significant technology or infrastructure project. This is the primary defense against technologies that create dependency, centralize power, waste resources, or have hidden social costs.

**Process:**  
1. Proposal & Preliminary Assessment: Review against core criteria of repairability, energy use, resource footprint, and freedom from coercive design
2. Multi-Domain "Future-Casting" Session: Role-playing long-term impacts on health, education, social equity, and ecology
3. Community-Wide Deliberation: Accessible presentation of findings and inclusive discussion
4. Provisional Pilot with Sunset Clause: Small-scale, time-bound pilot with real-world performance monitoring
5. Ratification, Redesign, or Rejection: Decision based on pilot data to fully adopt, redesign, or reject

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- "Technology Adoption & Impact Assessment" Protocol Suite: Technology lifecycle assessment tool, community benefit analyzer, infrastructure resilience tester, digital commons governance engine, maintenance & obsolescence planner
- Infrastructure Optimization Toolkit: Energy-water-data nexus optimizer, modular design selector, technology stack integrator, failure mode library

## Key Artifact
**Annual "Infrastructure Vitality & Liberation" Report**  
An annual assessment that measures the health, resilience, and liberating capacity of the community's technological and infrastructural bones and nervous systems.

**Contents:**  
- The "Appropriateness Index": Metrics tracking repairability, energy efficiency, and expected lifespan of key technologies
- Infrastructure Resilience Maps: Data on redundancy and failure points of critical systems
- "Liberation vs. Dependency" Analysis: Qualitative assessment of how technologies increased self-determination or created vulnerabilities
- Access & Digital Equity Metrics: Data on universal access to essential services and digital connectivity

**Beauty:** This artifact reframes infrastructure from cold, impersonal engineering to the enabling foundation of a free society. It tells a story of a community that masters its tools, builds systems that last for generations, and consciously chooses a technological path that enhances autonomy, community, and ecological harmony.

**Generation Systems:**  
- Annual "State of Our Infrastructure" Report System: Resilience index calculator, technology sovereignty assessment, infrastructure interdependence map, open source contribution tracker

## Education & Onboarding
