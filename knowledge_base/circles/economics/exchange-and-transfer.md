## Roles
**Mutual Aid Network Weaver** - Facilitates systems of non-monetized exchange and mutual support, strengthening the social fabric through generalized reciprocity.  
**Local Exchange Facilitator** - Manages the logistics of distributing goods and coordinating services within and between bioregional communities.  
**Commons Fund Steward** - Administers collectively managed resources for public projects, social care, and universal basic services, replacing coercive taxation.  
**Cultural Ambassador** - Facilitates meaningful and equitable cultural and material exchange with other communities, ensuring visits are respectful and mutually beneficial.  
**Solidarity Coordinator** - Manages the direct and unconditional sharing of surplus resources with other communities in times of need or imbalance.  
**Restorative Accountability Facilitator** - Guides processes for addressing broken agreements or harms, focusing on repairing relationships rather than punitive debt.

## Commons
**Livelyhood Flow Commons**  
A real-time, transparent dashboard and logistics platform that maps and facilitates the entire flow of goods, services, and mutual aid within and between communities. It functions as the circulatory system of the economic body.

**Significance:** This Commons makes the invisible economy of care, reciprocity, and resource flow visible. It prevents the hoarding of information and resources, ensuring the economy remains a living, responsive system.

## Critical Protocol
**"Scarce Resource Allocation" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To manage the high-stakes, recurring situation where a highly desired or essential resource cannot meet immediate demand. This is where "fairness" is most tested and where conflict over access can arise.

**Process:**  
1. Transparent Declaration: Immediate logging of scarcity with all relevant details
2. Needs-Based Triage: Process where claimants describe intended use and need, moving beyond simple queue
3. Deliberative Lottery: Public, weighted lottery favoring those with historical disadvantage or common good yield
4. Temporal Sharing Agreement: Co-ownership or time-sharing agreement with usage scheduled and tracked
5. Post-Allocation Review: Review of outcomes and process to identify systemic issues

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- "Scarce Resource Allocation" Protocol Suite: Scarcity declaration system, needs-based triage facilitator, deliberative lottery engine, temporal sharing agreement builder, post-allocation review system
- Exchange Optimization Toolkit: Flow health analyzer, mutual aid network designer, cultural exchange impact assessor, restorative accountability guide

## Key Artifact
**Annual "Flow of Gifts" Report**  
A beautiful and insightful assessment that reframes the community's economy not in terms of GDP, but in terms of the circulation of care, resources, and mutual support.

**Contents:**  
- Narrative of Reciprocity: Stories of how mutual aid networks successfully supported members
- Flow Metrics: Data visualizing volume and diversity of exchanges, efficiency of logistics networks, impact of solidarity projects
- The "Circulation Health" Index: Measure of economic vitality based on how quickly needs are met, participation breadth, and balance between giving and receiving
- Scarcity to Abundance Mapping: Analysis of allocation protocols, highlighting chronic scarcities and celebrating community-driven solutions

**Beauty:** This artifact makes visible the incredible, often unpaid, work of care and exchange that constitutes a thriving community. It proves that a healthy economy is defined by how well it circulates and how securely it meets everyone's needs.

**Generation Systems:**  
- Annual "Flow of Gifts" Report System: Reciprocity narrative weaver, flow metrics visualizer, circulation health index calculator, scarcity-to-abundance mapper
