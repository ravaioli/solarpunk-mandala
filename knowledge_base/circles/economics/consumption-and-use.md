## Roles
**Cradle-to-Cradle Systems Designer** - Plans and manages systems where all "waste" is redesigned as nutrient for another biological or technical process.  
**Food System Cultivator** - Grows, forages, or prepares food with a deep understanding of its nutritional, cultural, and ecological significance.  
**Needs & Abundance Mapper** - Creates a public, real-time map of community needs and available resources to optimize matching and minimize waste.  
**Public Utility Maintainer** - Ensures the resilient and equitable operation of decentralized, renewable energy grids and water catchment/purification systems.  
**Post-Extraction Material Guardian** - Manages the responsible and minimal use of legacy industrial materials, prioritizing their conservation in a circular economy.  
**Knowledge Sharer** - Focuses on spreading useful information, skills, and innovations through popular education, rather than creating demand for unneeded goods.

## Commons
**Circular Flow Hub**  
A dynamic, public platform that maps, manages, and optimizes the entire lifecycle of all physical objects and resources within the community, from sourcing to repurposing.

**Significance:** This Commons makes the community's material metabolism visible and manageable. It is the primary tool for eliminating waste, ensuring appropriate use and re-use, and transforming consumption from a private act into a collaboratively managed process.

## Digital Platforms & Physical Hubs
**Digital Platform: "The Circular Flow Hub"**  
- Material Passport System: Digital identities for all major goods tracking composition, repair history, and disassembly instructions
- Needs & Surplus Exchange: Real-time matching of community needs with available resources and skills
- Public Utility Dashboards: Live monitoring of water, energy, and resource flows with conservation tracking
- Legacy Material Registry: Database tracking petroleum-based and extractive materials for responsible phase-out

**Physical Hubs: "The Metabolic Center"**  
- Circular Marketplace: Space for sharing, repairing, and exchanging goods with repair stations
- Needs Mapping Room: Interactive displays showing community resource flows and unmet needs
- Utility Monitoring Station: Public displays of resource consumption with educational materials
- Material Library: Sample library of sustainable materials and their properties
- Knowledge Sharing Amphitheater: Space for workshops on sustainable consumption

## Core Pod
**Circular Flow Stewards Pod**  
**Mandate:** To nurture a community culture and practice where nothing is wasted, resources are valued and fully utilized, and consumption is a conscious, regenerative act aligned with ecological limits.

**Composition:**  
- Cradle-to-Cradle Systems Designer (Appropriate Use and Re-use)  
- Food System Cultivator (Food and Drink)  
- Needs & Abundance Mapper (Goods and Services)  
- Public Utility Maintainer (Water and Electricity)  
- Post-Extraction Material Guardian (Petroleum and Metals)  
- Knowledge Sharer (Promotion and Dissemination)

**Pod-Specific Workspaces:**  
- Metabolic Flow Dashboard: Real-time monitoring of all community resource flows
- Object Lifecycle Manager: Tracks items from introduction through reuse cycles
- Need-Surplus Matching Algorithm: Optimizes resource distribution across community
- Cultural Practice Innovation Lab: Space for developing new sharing and use models

**Pod Resource Kit:**  
- Cradle-to-Cradle Design Kit: Circular design principles, material flow mapping tools, lifecycle assessment guides
- Food System Toolkit: Preservation equipment, nutritional analysis tools, food sharing coordination materials
- Needs Mapping Kit: Community survey tools, resource tracking materials, abundance visualization aids
- Utility Maintenance Pack: Water and energy monitoring equipment, repair tools, efficiency improvement guides
- Knowledge Sharing Kit: Workshop materials, skill demonstration tools, cultural practice documentation

## Critical Protocol
**"New Object Introduction & Lifecycle" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To govern the high-stakes decision of introducing any new, non-perishable good into the community's material stream. This is the primary mechanism for preventing waste, avoiding toxin accumulation, and ensuring all objects are designed for the circular economy.

**Process:**  
1. Lifecycle Proposal: Submission detailing source materials, expected lifespan, repair plan, and end-of-life pathway
2. "Waste Audit" Review: Assessment of fit within community's metabolic cycles and waste potential
3. Community Need Assessment: Discussion on whether object fulfills genuine need or duplicates existing goods/services
4. Provisional Adoption with Stewardship Bond: Admission with deposit covering eventual recycling/disposal costs
5. Full Integration & Bond Return: Return of bond once object's lifecycle is proven to be circular

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- "New Object Introduction & Lifecycle" Protocol Suite: Lifecycle proposal builder, waste audit analyzer, community need validator, stewardship bond calculator, circular integration tracker
- Resource Flow Optimization Toolkit: Metabolic balance calculator, waste stream mapper, utility efficiency optimizer, cultural practice evolver

## Key Artifact
**Annual "Metabolism of Things" Report**  
A comprehensive and visually engaging audit that tells the story of what the community consumes, how it uses it, and where it all goes, measuring progress toward a true circular economy.

**Contents:**  
- The Circularity Quotient: Percentage of material flows that are cyclical versus linear
- Resource Wisdom Narratives: Stories of innovative appropriate use and re-use
- Utility & Footprint Analysis: Data on trends in water/electricity consumption and phasedown of petroleum/metals
- Needs Fulfillment Index: Analysis of how effectively material flows meet actual human needs

**Beauty:** This artifact reframes the community's relationship with "stuff." It is a celebration of mastery over material flows, showcasing a community that has learned to live well by valuing what it already has.

**Generation Systems:**  
- Annual "Metabolism of Things" Report System: Circularity quotient calculator, resource wisdom narrative curator, utility & footprint analyzer, needs fulfillment index

## Education & Onboarding
**Curriculum: "The Art of Conscious Consumption"**  
- Foundation Course: Principles of circular economy and mindful use
- Role Specialization: Training for each of the 6 consumption and use roles
- Advanced Metabolic Management: Complex system optimization, inter-community resource flows
- Cultural Transformation Design: Creating systems that shift from ownership to access

**Learning Experiences:**  
- "Metabolic Simulation": Managing virtual community resource flows
- Repair & Restoration Dojo: Hands-on skill development for extending object lifecycles
- Needs Mapping Workshop: Practice identifying and meeting community needs creatively
- Legacy Material Transformation Lab: Finding new uses for extractive-era materials

## Inter-Commons Exchange & Logistics
**Integrated Metabolic Network**  
- Cross-Domain Resource Sharing: Coordinates material flows between different Commons
- Regional Metabolic Balance: Manages resource exchanges with neighboring communities
- Shared Utility Infrastructure: Coordinates energy, water, and waste systems across domains
- Emergency Resource Protocol: Systems for resource sharing during shortages or crises

## Sensory & Experiential Installations
**"The Flow of Things" Installation** - Interactive sculpture showing real-time community resource flows.

**Community Metabolic Landmarks**  
- The Circularity Garden: Outdoor space demonstrating nutrient cycles and closed-loop systems
