## Roles
**Surplus Mobilizer** - Manages the community's collective surplus, directing it towards productive investments in future resilience and shared prosperity.  
**Commons Archivist** - Protects and curates the community's shared cultural and material inheritance, ensuring it is enhanced for future generations.  
**Universal Provisioner** - Distributes the means of livelihood (e.g., via resource credits or universal basic services) unconditionally to all community members.  
**Housing Guarantor** - Ensures high-quality, dignified housing is available to all as a human right, managed as a social good rather than a commodity.  
**Wealth Disparity Monitor** - Tracks distributions of wealth and power within the community and proposes corrective measures to prevent harmful inequality.  
**Participatory Budgeting Facilitator** - Guides the democratic process where the community decides how to allocate collective resources for projects and public goods.

## Commons
**Social Wealth Stewardship Commons**  
A transparent, living system that maps, manages, and democratically governs the community's collective wealth—both material (land, buildings, tools, funds) and immaterial (knowledge, culture, relationships).

**Significance:** This Commons prevents the concentration of wealth and power that characterizes capitalist economies. It transforms wealth from a private accumulation to a public trust, ensuring that abundance benefits all and is stewarded for future generations.

## Critical Protocol
**"Wealth Redistribution & Cap" Protocol**  
**Purpose:** To address the fundamental threat of wealth inequality by establishing and enforcing limits on individual accumulation while ensuring surplus wealth is productively redistributed for common benefit.

**Process:**  
1. Regular Wealth Audit: Comprehensive assessment of all forms of wealth accumulation in the community
2. Cap Threshold Deliberation: Community-wide discussion to set appropriate limits on private accumulation
3. Surplus Identification & Mobilization: Identification of wealth exceeding caps and planning for its redistribution
4. Participatory Redistribution Planning: Democratic process for deciding how redistributed wealth serves common good
5. Implementation & Impact Tracking: Execution of redistribution decisions with ongoing monitoring of effects

**Implementation Toolkits:**  
- "Wealth Justice & Stewardship" Protocol Suite: Wealth audit system, cap deliberation facilitator, surplus mobilization planner, redistribution impact tracker, intergenerational equity framework
- Distribution Optimization Toolkit: Needs assessment matrix, resource matching algorithm, equity impact simulator, abundance mindset cultivation tools

## Key Artifact
**Annual "State of Our Shared Wealth" Report**  
A courageous and comprehensive assessment that measures not just what the community owns, but how well that wealth is distributed, stewarded, and leveraged for collective flourishing.

**Contents:**  
- The "Distribution Health" Index: Metrics on wealth concentration, access to basic needs, and mobility between wealth levels
- Commons Stewardship Assessment: Evaluation of how well collective assets are maintained and utilized
- Redistribution Impact Analysis: Data on how wealth transfers have affected community well-being
- Intergenerational Equity Score: Assessment of how well wealth is preserved and enhanced for future generations

**Beauty:** This artifact reframes wealth from a measure of individual success to a measure of collective health. It tells the story of a community that has learned to see abundance as something to be shared, stewarded, and celebrated together rather than hoarded.

**Generation Systems:**  
- Annual "State of Our Shared Wealth" Report System: Distribution health index calculator, commons stewardship assessment, redistribution impact analyzer, intergenerational equity score

## Sensory & Experiential Installations
**"The River of Abundance" Installation** - Interactive water and light feature showing real-time flows of resources through the community, with currents representing distribution patterns.

**Community Wealth Landmarks**  
- The Commons Fountain: Water feature where flow represents community resource levels
- The Redistribution Plaza: Public space celebrating fair distribution and mutual aid
- The Intergenerational Wisdom Wall: Evolving display of community heritage and future aspirations
