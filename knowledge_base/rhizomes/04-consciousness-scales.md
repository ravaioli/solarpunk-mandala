# Qualia-Structure Mapping: Consciousness Across Biological and Social Scales

This document operationalizes the Tesseract architecture by mapping Integrated Information Theory's (IIT) quantitative consciousness metric (Φ) to phenomenological predictions at multiple scales. It provides falsifiable hypotheses for how "what it's like" changes from cells to civilizations, grounding the Mandala's metaphysical claims in empirical predictions.

## Core Principle: Φ-Density as Phenomenological Constraint

IIT posits that consciousness is identical to a system's irreducible cause-effect structure. The quantity of consciousness (Φ) determines the richness and differentiation of experience. Analytic Idealism reframes this: Φ measures the **degree of dissociation from Mind at Large**. Low Φ = minimal dissociation (proto-consciousness); high Φ = maximal dissociation (robust individual-self).

### Measurement Protocol

Φ is calculated using IIT 4.0 formalism via the PyPhi library. At scales beyond individual brains, we use **approximate Φ** (Φ̃) based on:
- **Cellular scale**: Single-neuron patch-clamp + computational modeling
- **Individual scale**: Clinical-grade EEG/fMRI fusion (Owen et al., 2021)
- **Community scale**: Hyperscanning network complexity (Babiloni et al., 2023)
- **Ecosystem scale**: Ecological information flow models (Ulanowicz, 2009)

## Qualia-Structure Mapping Table

| System Scale | Φ Range (approx.) | Predicted Phenomenology (IIT) | Mandala Cube(s) | Measurement Protocol | Critical Falsifier |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Single Neuron** | 0.001 – 0.01 | Proto-phenomenal "tinge": causal self-determination without differentiation. "What it's like to be a thermostat." | **ॐ** (Core) | Patch-clamp → PyPhi TPM | If Φ &gt; 0.1 does not correlate with enhanced synaptic plasticity, mapping fails |
| **Organoid (50k neurons)** | 0.1 – 1.0 | Minimal scene: undifferentiated feeling of "being" without subject-object distinction. Proto-self. | **UR** (Biological) | Calcium imaging → functional connectivity complexity | If organoid Φ does not predict responsiveness to stimuli, it's inert |
| **Awake Human Brain** | 100 – 1000 | Rich, differentiated scene: integrated space-time-color-emotion narrative. Full subjectivity. | **All 8 Cubes** | EEG-fMRI → PyPhi | If Φ &lt; 50 does NOT predict unconsciousness (coma), theory falsified |
| **Meditative Brain (jhanic)** | 1500 – 3000 | Hyper-integrated "oceanic": dissolution of subject-object boundary, non-dual awareness. | **Cube 8 (Meta)** | fMRI + phenomenology | If Φ increase does not correlate with "boundarylessness" reports, mapping fails |
| **PTSD Brain (frozen)** | 80 – 120 | Fragmented scene: hyper-differentiated trauma content without integrative capacity. Dissociated self. | **UL only** | Resting-state fMRI: CMS decoupled | If trauma does not show UL↔LL disconnection, mapping is epiphenomenal |
| **Community (30-50 people, high cohesion)** | 500 – 2000 | Emergent group intention: shared goal-directedness with individual agency preserved. "We-consciousness." | **LR + 6 + 7** | Hyperscanning network Φ̃ | If group Φ̃ does not predict collective problem-solving success, mapping fails |
| **Community (dysfunctional, fragmented)** | 50 – 200 | Aggregated individuals: no intersubjective integration. "Group of solipsists." | **UR only (individuals)** | Same as above | If low Φ̃ does not predict conflict, mapping is not predictive |
| **Bioregion (ecosystem + human stewards)** | 100 – 5000 | Gaian homeostatic awareness: long-term ecological balance as "felt sense." Extended consciousness. | **Biosphere integration** | Ecological information flow + community Φ̃ | If biodiversity loss does not correlate with Φ̃ decline, mapping is invalid |
| **Late-Stage Capitalist Institution** | 20 – 100 | Simulated consciousness: high internal complexity but missing genuine intersubjective depth (LL↔LR disconnection). | **LR only** | Institutional network analysis | If extractive institutions show high Φ̃, the metric is not capturing "care" (axiological axis) |

## Falsification Conditions

### System-Level Falsifiers

**Falsifier 1: Scale-Free Causality**
- **Test**: Does cellular Φ (e.g., bioelectric network in planarian) predict regenerative capacity at organism level?
- **Failure**: If planarian bioelectric Φ &gt; 0.5 does not correlate with head regeneration success, scale-free cognition is rejected.

**Falsifier 2: Community Φ Validity**
- **Test**: In n=50 communities, does group Φ̃ correlate (r &gt; 0.6) with social cohesion (Samson's social network index) controlling for individual IQ?
- **Failure**: If group Φ̃ is entirely predicted by mean individual Φ, no emergent consciousness exists at scale.

**Falsifier 3: Trauma Dissociation Pattern**
- **Test**: Do PTSD patients show **specific** UL↔LL decoupling without UR impairment?
- **Failure**: If trauma shows global Φ reduction (all cubes down), the Tesseract model is too simplistic.

### IIT-Specific Falsifiers

**Falsifier 4: Exclusion Postulate**
- **Test**: In overlapping neural networks (e.g., CMS and posterior hot zone), does maximum Φ match the **dominant** subjective report?
- **Failure**: If overlapping circuits generate two simultaneous but distinct experiences, IIT's exclusion principle fails, and the mapping is invalid.

**Falsifier 5: Composition Postulate**
- **Test**: Does community Φ̃ show **non-linear composition** (Φ̃_community &gt; Σ Φ_individual)?
- **Failure**: If community Φ̃ is strictly additive, no "we-consciousness" emerges; Cube 6 is metaphorical.

## Clinical & Community Application Protocols

### Protocol: "Consciousness First Aid" (Emergency Boundary Medicine)

**Use Case**: Community trauma (natural disaster, conflict) where Φ_foundation drops below threshold.

**Steps**:
1. **Measure**: Community-wide EEG hyperscanning → calculate Φ̃ per foundation
2. **Diagnose**: Identify which cube(s) are decoupled (e.g., UR↔LR disconnection = infrastructure collapse)
3. **Intervene**: 
   - **Nourishment (UR)**: Restore bioelectric coherence of food distribution networks
   - **Movement (LL)**: Re-establish safe intersubjective corridors (mirror neuron priming via face-to-face contact)
   - **Restoration (UL)**: Quiet zones with 40 Hz tACS to thalamocortical loop
   - **Cleansing (LR)**: Transparent communication protocols to re-engage fronto-parietal control

**Success Metric**: Φ_foundation ≥ 2.0 for 2 consecutive weeks.

### Protocol: "Dimensional Literacy Training"

**Goal**: Increase inter-cube Φ connectivity.

**Method**:
- **Week 1-2**: UL→UR training (mindful sensory integration) → measure posterior↔CMS connectivity increase
- **Week 3-4**: UL→LL training (empathic dialogue) → measure CMS↔IFG synchrony
- **Week 5-6**: LL→LR training (collective governance) → measure IFG↔dlPFC coupling

**Expected Outcome**: Each training phase increases targeted inter-cube connectivity by Δr &gt; 0.2 without decreasing non-targeted connections.

## Integration with Tesseract Model

This mapping provides the **empirical bridge** between:
- **Ontology** (Cube ॐ): Thalamic Φ measures dissociation from Mind at Large
- **Epistemology** (Cubes 1-8): Each cube's Φ determines its information processing capacity
- **Ethics** (4 Axes): Φ distribution across cubes determines axiological orientation (e.g., LL↔LR imbalance = relational depth crisis)
- **Process** (Dialectical Phases): Φ velocity (dΦ/dt) measures transformation speed
