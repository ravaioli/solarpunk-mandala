No Poverty
Objectives
End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Key Facts (U.N. Data, 2018)

767 million people live below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day.

The overwhelming majority of people living below the poverty line belong to two regions: Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

High poverty rates are often found in small, fragile and conflict-affected countries.

One in four children under age five in the world has inadequate height for his or her age.

Every day in 2014, 42,000 people had to abandon their homes to seek protection due to conflict.

Asia is the continent with the most hungry people – two thirds of the total.

Southern Asia faces the greatest hunger burden, with about 281 million undernourished people.
