To put this into perspective, for each 1 degree of temperature increase, grain yields decline by about 5 per cent. Maize, wheat and other major crops have experienced significant yield reductions at the global level of 40 megatonnes per year between 1981 and 2002 due to a warmer climate.Oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished and sea level has risen. From 1901 to 2010, the global average sea level rose by 19 cm as oceans expanded due to warming and ice melted. The Arctic’s sea ice extent has shrunk in every successive decade since 1979, with 1.07 million km² of ice loss every decade.Given current concentrations and on-going emissions of greenhouse gases, it is likely that by the end of this century, the increase in global temperature will exceed 1.5°C compared to 1850 to 1900 for all but one scenario. The world’s oceans will warm and ice melt will continue. Average sea level rise is predicted as 24 – 30cm by 2065 and 40-63cm by 2100. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions are stopped.Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased by almost 50 per cent since 1990.Emissions grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in each of the three previous decades.It is still possible, using a wide array of technological measures and changes in behaviour, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Major institutional and technological change will give a better than even chance that global warming will not exceed this threshold.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

Complicating issues arise when enquiry is completely harnessed for instrumental ends.

Humanity must therefore rely on 0.5 per cent for all of man’s ecosystem’s and fresh water needs.Man is polluting water faster than nature can recycle and purify water in rivers and lakes.More than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water.Excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress.Water is free from nature but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive.Despite technological advances that have promoted energy efficiency gains, energy use in OECD countries will continue to grow another 35 per cent by 2020. Commercial and residential energy use is the second most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport.In 2002 the motor vehicle stock in OECD countries was 550 million vehicles (75 per cent of which were personal cars). A 32 per cent increase in vehicle ownership is expected by 2020. At the same time, motor vehicle kilometres are projected to increase by 40 per cent and global air travel is projected to triple in the same period.Households consume 29 per cent of global energy and consequently contribute to 21 per cent of resultant CO2 emissions.One-fifth of the world’s final energy consumption in 2013 was from renewables.While substantial environmental impacts from food occur in the production phase (agriculture, food processing), households influence these impacts through their dietary choices and habits. This consequently affects the environment through food-related energy consumption and waste generation.1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted every year while almost 1 billion people go undernourished and another 1 billion hungry.Overconsumption of food is detrimental to our health and the environment.2 billion people globally are overweight or obese.Land degradation, declining soil fertility, unsustainable water use, overfishing and marine environment degradation are all lessening the ability of the natural resource base to supply food.The food sector accounts for around 30 per cent of the world’s total energy consumption and accounts for around 22 per cent of total Greenhouse Gas emissions.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,
