# Appendix C: α-Coefficient Diagnostic Protocols

## Introduction
The α-coefficient is a diagnostic metric that measures community coherence across the four ethical axes (Soteriological, Axiological, Relational, Temporal) while accounting for embodied foundation stability. This appendix provides protocols for calculating and applying the α-coefficient at individual, project, and community scales.

## C.0 α-Coefficient Mathematical Definition
The α-coefficient is calculated as:
α = (S + A + R + T) / 4 × E

Where:
- **S** = Soteriological axis score (1-5)
- **A** = Axiological axis score (1-5) 
- **R** = Relational axis score (1-5)
- **T** = Temporal axis score (1-5)
- **E** = Embodied Foundations multiplier (1.0 if all foundations ≥2, 0.5 if any foundation <2)

## Boundary Rules
1. **Foundation Threshold**: The α-coefficient cannot exceed 2.0 when any foundation scores below 2
2. **Dialectical Velocity Integration**: Multiply final α by dialectical velocity metric (0-1.0) to get operational α for decision-making
3. **Phase Alignment**: Interpret α scores within context of current dialectical phase (0D-4D)

## C.1 Individual: SolarPunk Compass Check
Rate 1–5 on:
1. **Soteriological**: "My inner life feels integrated." → Spirituality Elements
2. **Axiological**: "My skills serve regenerative systems." → Economics + Ecology Elements
3. **Relational**: "I heal through relationship." → Culture Elements
4. **Temporal**: "I honor past and future." → Culture: Memory & Projection
→ α ≈ average. <3 = contraction; >4 = unfolding.

## C.2 Project Team: Rhizomatic α-Audit
Use Protocol 2 to assess:
1. **Soteriological**: Spirituality + MAN alignment
2. **Axiological**: Economics + Ecology + SHELLS
3. **Relational**: Culture + SOCIETY
4. **Temporal**: Culture: Memory & Projection
→ α = (S + A + R + T) / 4 × E. Drops below 2.0 if any axis scores <2 or any foundation <2.
5. **Embodied Axis**: Embodied Foundations (Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, Movement)
6. **Dialectical Velocity Metric**: Rate 0-1.0 on movement between phases
7. **Boundary Rule**: "If any foundation scores <2 or velocity metric <0.2, focus on foundation-building before higher-dimensional work"

## C.3 Community: Settlement α-Dashboard
Use Protocol 1 to score:
1. **Soteriological**: Spirituality (7 Elements) + MAN (7 Sub-Elements)
2. **Axiological**: Economics + Ecology + SHELLS + NETWORKS
3. **Relational**: Culture + SOCIETY
4. **Temporal**: Culture: Memory & Projection + NATURE: Climate
→ α = (S + A + R + T) / 4 × E. Cannot exceed 2.0 if any foundation <2.
5. **Embodied Axis**: Embodied Foundations (Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, Movement)
6. **Dialectical Velocity Metric**: Rate 0-1.0 on movement between phases
7. **Boundary Rule**: "If any foundation scores <2 or velocity metric <0.2, focus on foundation-building before higher-dimensional work"

## Practical Applications

### Step-by-Step Community Assessment
1. **Gather Community**: Assemble representative group in hexagonal arrangement
2. **Score Each Axis**: Use discussion and consensus to score S, A, R, T (1-5)
3. **Assess Foundations**: Evaluate all four embodied foundations
4. **Calculate Velocity**: Rate community's movement between phases (0-1.0)
5. **Compute α**: Apply formula with foundation multiplier
6. **Interpret Results**:
   - α < 2.0: Foundation-focused work required
   - α 2.0-3.0: Balanced development across dimensions
   - α 3.0-4.0: Regenerative capacity with leadership potential
   - α 4.0-5.0: Advanced integration ready for mentoring others

### Case Study: Rural Food Sovereignty Network
**Context**: Network of 12 farms and 3 distribution hubs serving 500+ households.

**Assessment Results**:
- Soteriological: 4.2 (Strong spiritual connection to land)
- Axiological: 3.8 (Good economic systems but some waste challenges)
- Relational: 3.9 (Strong community bonds, some tension over resources)
- Temporal: 3.5 (Seasonal planning good, long-term vision needs work)
- Foundations: All ≥3.0
- Velocity: 0.75 (Moving well between 2D-3D)

**Calculated α**: (4.2 + 3.8 + 3.9 + 3.5) / 4 × 1.0 × 0.75 = 3.85

**Interpretation**: High coherence with regenerative capacity. Ready for leadership role in mentoring other communities while strengthening temporal axis.
