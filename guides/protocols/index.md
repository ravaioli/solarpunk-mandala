# IV. Protocols: The Living Architecture of Regeneration

The SolarPunk Mandala is not a theoretical construct—it is a living geometry of action. Protocols transform the Mandala's elegant framework into tangible, day-to-day practice. Each protocol is a field-tested method for navigating specific dimensions of community regeneration, with Embodied Foundations as their non-negotiable core.

## Core Protocol Sequence

The protocols form an integrated ecosystem, not a linear checklist:

1. **[Protocol 0: Embodied Foundations Audit](00-embodied-foundations.md)**  
   *The Ground of All Action*  
   Before any transformation can occur, basic human needs must be met. This protocol ensures communities have the physical and emotional stability required for meaningful systemic change. Functions as the operating system upon which all other protocols run.

2. **[Protocol 1: Settlement Health Assessment](01-settlement-health.md)**  
   *Diagnosing Contraction and Regenerative Force*  
   This protocol maps the current state of community health across the Four Axes of Transformation (Soteriological, Axiological, Relational, Temporal). It identifies where intervention is most needed, functioning as the diagnostic engine that guides strategic action.

3. **[Protocol 2: Project Design Integration](02-project-design.md)**  
   *From Diagnosis to Wholeness*  
   This protocol ensures holistic project design that integrates space, function, and purpose. Projects must address all four Embodied Foundations and align with Mandala Pathways to avoid bypassing and fragmentation.

4. **[Protocol 3: Crisis Response Framework](03-crisis-response.md)**  
   *Navigating Emergencies While Protecting the Regenerative Core*  
   When emergencies arise—natural disasters, economic shocks, health crises—the regenerative core must be protected. This protocol ensures crisis response strengthens rather than undermines long-term community resilience.

## Protocol Selection Guide

| When to Activate | Primary Protocol | Foundation Requirements |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Starting any community work, after crisis, burnout patterns | Protocol 0 | N/A (assesses foundations) |
| Beginning transformation work, after major events, strategic planning | Protocol 1 | All foundations ≥2 |
| Designing new community initiatives, infrastructure projects | Protocol 2 | Varies by pathway:<br>- Awakening: Restoration ≥3<br>- Making: Nourishment ≥3<br>- Liberation: Movement ≥3<br>- Healing: Cleansing ≥3 |
| Natural disasters, economic shocks, health emergencies | Protocol 3 | All foundations ≥1 (minimum for responders) |

## Key Integration Principles

1. **Embodied Foundations First**: No protocol can proceed without stable foundations. If foundations score below threshold requirements, all other work pauses until foundations are restored.

2. **Non-Linear Flow**: While protocols follow a logical sequence, communities may move between protocols based on needs. Protocol 3 can interrupt any ongoing protocol during crisis.

3. **Pathway Activation**: Each protocol activates specific Mandala Pathways based on foundation stability:
   - Protocol 0 primarily activates Healing (Cura)
   - Protocol 1 primarily activates Awakening (Conscientização)
   - Protocol 2 primarily activates Making (Capacitação) and Liberation (Liberação)
   - Protocol 3 integrates all pathways based on crisis type

4. **Boundary Medicine**: All protocols include boundary medicine practices that heal dissociation between:
   - Individual and collective
   - Spiritual and practical
   - Past and future
   - Human and ecological

5. **Living Documentation**: Every protocol implementation contributes to the community's Living Archive, creating a wisdom repository that evolves with practice.

## Getting Started

1. Begin with [Protocol 0](00-embodied-foundations.md) to assess your community's current foundation state
2. Use the [Satsang Loom](https://solarpunksangha.com/satsang) to weave protocols with pathways and vertices
3. Download the complete [Protocol Workbook](https://solarpunksangha.com/protocols) for practical tools
4. Connect with a [Community Pod](https://solarpunksangha.com/pods) for implementation support

The protocols are not rigid rules but living practices—continuously refined through community wisdom and embodied experience. As you work with them, contribute your insights to the Living Archive to help the framework evolve.
