# Protocol 0: Embodied Foundations Audit

## Purpose
Ensure basic human needs are met before higher-order transformation can occur. This protocol verifies that communities have the physical and emotional stability required for meaningful systemic change.

## When to Use This Protocol
- **Activate when**: Starting any community project, after any crisis event, or when burnout patterns emerge
- **Deactivate when**: All foundations score 4+ and community shows stable patterns of self-care
- **Frequency**: Monthly for new communities, quarterly for established communities

## Embodied Foundations Gate Check
Before proceeding with this protocol, verify all four foundations meet minimum thresholds:

| Foundation | Current Score (1-5) | Minimum Required | Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Nourishment** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Cleansing** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Restoration** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Movement** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |

> **Boundary Rule**: If any foundation scores below 2, pause all other protocols and activate Protocol 3 with foundation focus until all foundations meet minimum requirements.

## Core Assessment Questions
Score each question 1-5 (1=Never/False, 5=Always/True)

### Nourishment Domain
1. Do community members have reliable access to nutritious food and clean water? _____
2. Are communal eating spaces available and welcoming to all? _____
3. Do food systems connect people to seasonal cycles and local ecology? _____

### Cleansing Domain
1. Do all community members have access to clean water for bathing and hygiene? _____
2. Are waste systems designed to transform rather than dispose? _____
3. Are emotional cleansing practices (grief circles, conflict resolution) regularly available? _____

### Restoration Domain
1. Do community members have access to adequate sleep and rest spaces? _____
2. Are trauma healing resources accessible to those who need them? _____
3. Are daily and seasonal rest rhythms honored in community rhythms? _____

### Movement Domain
1. Can all community members move safely through community spaces? _____
2. Are there regular opportunities for communal movement (dance, walking, labor)? _____
3. Do decision-making systems allow for movement of power and resources? _____

## Scoring Rubric

| Score Range | Interpretation | Next Steps |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1.0-1.9 | Emergency level - immediate intervention required | Activate Protocol 3 with foundation focus |
| 2.0-2.9 | Foundational level - can proceed with basic protocols | Use simplified version of this protocol |
| 3.0-3.9 | Stable level - ready for intermediate work | Proceed with standard protocol |
| 4.0-5.0 | Regenerative level - ready for advanced transformation | Add complexity and depth to protocol |

## Dialectical Phase Assessment
Rate your community's current movement between phases on a 0-1.0 scale:
- **0.0-0.2**: Stagnant - focused on survival
- **0.3-0.6**: Transitioning - actively changing  
- **0.7-1.0**: Flowing - natural movement between phases

**Current Dialectical Velocity**: _____

> **Integration Note**: If dialectical velocity is below 0.2, focus only on the most critical foundation rather than all dimensions of this protocol.

## Dissociation Lens Assessment
For each foundation domain:
1. Which dissociation boundary does this foundation heal? (Cube 5: body-MAL boundary)
2. How does stabilizing this foundation help us remember belonging to Mind at Large?
3. What boundary medicine practices support this foundation? (e.g., communal eating for Nourishment)

## Hexagonal Connection Map
[Center Cell: Embodied Foundations Core]
- **Surrounding Cells**: Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, Movement, Community Care, Natural Cycles
- **Connections**: Draw lines between cells where strong relationships exist
- **Blockages**: Mark areas where connections are damaged or missing

## Case Study
**Context**: Detroit Water Justice Network during 2014 water shutoffs  
**Application**: The network used this protocol to assess community foundations. Nourishment scored 1.2 (food insecurity), Cleansing scored 0.8 (no water access), Restoration scored 1.5 (disrupted sleep from stress), Movement scored 1.8 (fear of moving through neighborhoods). This triggered Protocol 3 emergency response focused on water distribution and mutual aid networks before any other community work could proceed.

**Outcome**: By focusing on foundation stabilization first, the network built trust and capacity that later enabled more complex organizing. When foundations reached minimum scores of 2.5+, they were able to engage in deeper systemic work around water rights and policy change.

## Dimensional Movement Indicators
Track progress through dimensional unfolding:

| From → To | Indicator of Movement | MAL Integration |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **0D → 1D** | When emergency water/food distribution stabilizes to regular schedule | Remembering that survival needs connect us to universal patterns of care |
| **1D → 2D** | When community members begin participating in decision-making about resource allocation | Recognizing shared responsibility as expression of collective consciousness |
| **2D → 3D** | When waste systems transform from disposal to regeneration | Seeing waste transformation as MAL's intelligence expressed through human systems |
| **3D → 4D** | When all four foundations are integrated in community design and ritual | Living as if personal and collective needs are expressions of the same consciousness |

## MAL Reflection Space
How does this protocol help us remember our belonging to Mind at Large?

When we attend to basic needs like food, water, rest, and movement, we honor the body as consciousness made visible. These foundations are not separate from spiritual practice—they are the ground from which all transformation emerges. By ensuring everyone's needs are met, we dissolve the illusion that some lives matter more than others, remembering that all beings are expressions of the same Mind at Large experiencing itself through different boundaries.

## Facilitator Notes
**Preparation**:
- Quiet, comfortable space for assessment
- Food and water available for participants
- Pens, worksheets, and colored markers for scoring
- 90-120 minutes of uninterrupted time

**During Facilitation**:
- Begin with a grounding practice (3 minutes of shared breathing)
- Emphasize that there are no "right" answers—this is about honest assessment
- Score based on the most vulnerable community members, not the most privileged
- Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- Watch for signs of dissociation or trauma when discussing foundations

**After Completion**:
- Document scores and reflections
- Create immediate action plan for any foundation scoring below 2
- Schedule follow-up assessment within 2 weeks if foundations are unstable
- Share results with community in accessible format

## Integration with Other Protocols

| Protocol | Integration Point | Action Required |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Protocol 0** | Foundation stability assessment | Complete before any other protocol |
| **Protocol 1** | Settlement Health Assessment | Cannot proceed if any foundation <2 |
| **Protocol 2** | Project Design Integration | Requires all foundations ≥3 for complex projects |
| **Protocol 3** | Crisis Response Framework | Activated immediately if foundations drop below 2 |
