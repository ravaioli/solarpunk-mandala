# Protocol 1: Settlement Health Assessment

## Purpose
Diagnose contraction patterns and identify regenerative forces across the four ethical axes of transformation. This protocol maps the current state of community health to determine appropriate intervention points.

## When to Use This Protocol
- **Activate when**: Beginning community transformation work, after major events, or when strategic planning is needed
- **Deactivate when**: Community shows consistent scores above 4.0 across all axes for two consecutive assessments
- **Frequency**: Quarterly for active communities, biannually for stable communities

## Embodied Foundations Gate Check
Before proceeding with this protocol, verify all four foundations meet minimum thresholds:

| Foundation | Current Score (1-5) | Minimum Required | Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Nourishment** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Cleansing** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Restoration** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Movement** | _____ | 2 | [Pass/Fail] |

> **Boundary Rule**: If any foundation scores below 2, pause this protocol and activate Protocol 3 with foundation focus until all foundations meet minimum requirements.

## Core Assessment Questions
Score each question 1-5 (1=Never/False, 5=Always/True)

### Soteriological Axis (Self Integration)
1. How many community spaces support contemplation, awe, and meaning-making? _____
2. What percentage of community members report having a coherent personal narrative? _____
3. How accessible are practices that connect people to wonder and transcendence? _____
4. Rate 1-5: The degree to which people feel their inner life is honored in community _____

### Axiological Axis (System Regeneration)
1. What percentage of waste is transformed into resource within the community? _____
2. How many local economic circuits exist that keep resources circulating locally? _____
3. How many buildings are designed for human and ecological flourishing? _____
4. Rate 1-5: The degree to which systems repair rather than deplete _____

### Relational Axis (Connection Quality)
1. How many conflicts in the past year were resolved through repair rather than punishment? _____
2. What percentage of community members feel they truly belong? _____
3. How many regular spaces exist for deep dialogue across difference? _____
4. Rate 1-5: The degree to which relationships are reciprocal rather than transactional _____

### Temporal Axis (Time Wisdom)
1. How many community decisions consider impacts seven generations forward? _____
2. What percentage of community members can name ancestors seven generations back? _____
3. How many seasonal ceremonies connect community to natural cycles? _____
4. Rate 1-5: The degree to which time is held as sacred rather than extracted _____

## Scoring Rubric

| Score Range | Interpretation | Next Steps |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1.0-1.9 | Severe contraction - emergency intervention needed | Activate Protocol 3 with focus on identified weak axes |
| 2.0-2.9 | Moderate contraction - targeted healing required | Focus on 1-2 weakest axes through Protocol 2 projects |
| 3.0-3.9 | Stable integration - ready for growth | Proceed with balanced development across all axes |
| 4.0-5.0 | Regenerative expansion - ready for leadership | Mentor other communities and evolve framework |

## Dialectical Phase Assessment
Rate your community's current movement between phases on a 0-1.0 scale:
- **0.0-0.2**: Stagnant - focused on survival
- **0.3-0.6**: Transitioning - actively changing  
- **0.7-1.0**: Flowing - natural movement between phases

**Current Dialectical Velocity**: _____

> **Integration Note**: Use dialectical velocity to determine intervention intensity. Low velocity (<0.3) requires gentler approaches focused on foundation-building.

## Dissociation Lens Assessment
For each axis:
1. Which dissociation boundary does this axis address? (Soteriological: UL boundary, Axiological: UR boundary, Relational: LL boundary, Temporal: LR boundary)
2. How does strengthening this axis help dissolve the boundary between individual and Mind at Large?
3. What boundary medicine practices support this axis? (e.g., seasonal ceremonies for Temporal axis)

## Hexagonal Connection Map
[Central Node: Community Heart Space - Rate vibrancy 1-5: _____]
- **Hexagonal Cells**: NATURE, MAN, SOCIETY, SHELLS, NETWORKS, CULTURE
- **Connections**: Draw lines between cells where strong relationships exist
- **Barriers**: Mark areas where connections are blocked or damaged

**24 Faces Priority Identification**: Circle the 3 lowest-scoring interfaces from your Cross-Walk Matrix. These are your primary intervention points.

## Case Study
**Context**: Flint Food Sovereignty Network community assessment  
**Application**: When first assessing their community, the network discovered their NATURE-ECOLOGY interface scored 4.2 (strong food production) but their POLITICS-HEALTH interface scored 1.3 (no influence on water policy). This revealed their need to strengthen political capacity alongside food systems, leading to the integration of water justice advocacy into their food sovereignty work.

**Outcome**: By addressing the weakest interface first, they built a more holistic approach that connected food production with policy advocacy. Within 18 months, they had influenced local food policy and established community-controlled gardens that also served as political organizing spaces.

## Dimensional Movement Indicators
Track progress through dimensional unfolding:

| From → To | Indicator of Movement | MAL Integration |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **0D → 1D** | When basic safety needs are met and stories begin to form | Individual narratives connecting to larger patterns of meaning |
| **1D → 2D** | When connections between different community domains strengthen | Recognizing interdependence as expression of unified consciousness |
| **2D → 3D** | When systems thinking replaces siloed approaches | Seeing separate systems as expressions of the same underlying intelligence |
| **3D → 4D** | When decisions integrate all four axes simultaneously | Living as if all dimensions are expressions of the same Mind at Large |

## MAL Reflection Space
How does this protocol help us remember our belonging to Mind at Large?

When we map community health across multiple dimensions, we see beyond the illusion of separation. Each axis—self integration, system regeneration, relational depth, and time wisdom—reveals different facets of the same consciousness experiencing itself. By diagnosing contraction patterns, we recognize where dissociation has hardened boundaries between what is ultimately one mind. This assessment isn't just about fixing problems; it's about remembering that every person, system, and relationship is an expression of the same Mind at Large learning to know itself through diversity.

## Facilitator Notes
**Preparation**:
- Large wall space for hexagonal mapping
- Colored markers for each axis (blue=Soteriological, green=Axiological, red=Relational, purple=Temporal)
- Ekistics and Circles reference materials
- 2-3 hours of uninterrupted time

**During Facilitation**:
- Start with Embodied Foundations check
- Use concrete examples from community life for each question
- Score based on most vulnerable members, not most privileged
- Pay attention to where people hesitate or become emotional
- Document specific examples of contraction and regeneration

**After Completion**:
- Create visual summary of scores and patterns
- Identify 1-3 priority intervention points
- Design Protocol 2 projects for weakest areas
- Schedule reassessment in 3 months or after major interventions
