## The Template

**Subject:** 🪷 [Community Name] Monthly Pulse Check: [Month]'s Voice

**Body:**

Hello everyone,

This is your invitation to participate in our monthly **Community Pulse Check**.

**What is this?**
This is a short, reflective poll (about 10 minutes) designed to "take the temperature" of our community life. It asks for your perceptions and feelings across different domains—like our relationships, our shared work, and our connection to the land.

**Why does it matter?**
Your individual voice is essential. When blended anonymously with others, your responses create a unique snapshot of our collective experience. This snapshot becomes the **qualitative heart** of our Regeneration Flower, guiding our conversations about what to nurture and where to grow.

**Key Principles:**
-   **Anonymous:** Your individual responses are never shared.
-   **No Right Answers:** Answer with honesty, not what you think is "expected."
-   **Used for Learning:** The results are used only to inform our whole-community sense-making and care.

**Take the Poll Here:**

The poll will close on **[Day, Date]** to allow us to synthesize the results for our next community circle.

Thank you for contributing your voice. It is a vital thread in the fabric of our shared well-being.

With care,

The [Dashboard Stewards / Community Care Pod]

**🔹 Facilitator's Note – For Low-Tech Communities:**
*If you're not using a digital poll, adapt this message to announce a **physical ballot box** in a common area. Provide printed slips with the poll questions (see the `06-templates-and-printables/` folder for a printable version). The principles of anonymity and purpose remain the same.*
