# Steward Check-in Guide

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide is for the **Dashboard Coordinator** to conduct a brief, effective coordination meeting with all Domain Stewards at the start of **Week 1**. The goal is to ensure everyone is clear, supported, and connected, preventing silos and confusion.

## Suggested Format: 20-Minute Huddle

**Time:** Early in Week 1 (e.g., Monday or Tuesday).
**Format:** A quick stand-up or circle, in-person or via voice call. Keep it focused.

## Suggested Agenda & Script

### 1. Opening & Re-Cap (2 min)
*"Welcome, stewards. Thank you for holding this role for our cycle. Let's do a quick round to check our grounding. In one word, what's your energy or feeling heading into this data gathering?"* (Go around the circle quickly).

### 2. Role Clarity & Source Check (5 min)
*"Let's do a super-fast confirmation for each domain. Please state:*
1.  *Your domain.*
2.  *The **one or two key quantitative metrics** you'll be tracking this cycle.*
3.  *Where you'll get the data from (e.g., 'from the garden log sheet,' 'by asking the kitchen team')."*

**🔹 Coordinator's Task:** Listen and gently note if anyone seems unsure of their source. Offer to help problem-solve *after* the huddle.

### 3. Identifying Blocks & Needs (5 min)
*"What, if anything, feels tricky or unclear about gathering your data this week? Is there a missing log, an unclear person to ask, or a metric that feels confusing?"*

**🔹 Coordinator's Task:** Do not solve in depth here. Simply note who needs help and say, *"[Name], I'll connect with you right after this huddle to figure that out."*

### 4. Timeline & Hand-off Reminder (3 min)
*"A quick reminder on timing: please aim to get your numbers to [Name of Visual Steward] by **[Date, e.g., Friday EOD]** in whatever format you've agreed (e.g., a number in a text, a filled cell in the shared sheet).*
*Does that timeline work for everyone, given what you just shared?"* (Get verbal confirmation).

### 5. Closing & Appreciation (1 min)
*"Perfect. My job is to support you. Please message me directly if you hit any snags. Thank you for this essential act of attention for our community. Let's close."*

## Post-Huddle Actions for the Coordinator

1.  **Immediately** follow up 1-on-1 with any steward who expressed a block.
2.  **Send a brief summary** of the agreed timelines and hand-off to the Visual Steward and all stewards via text or chat. For example:
    *"Quick recap: All Q data to [Visual Steward] by Fri EOD. [Ecology Steward] needs help with the commute survey data—I'll assist. Thanks all!"*
3.  **Mid-Week Pulse Check:** Send a simple, low-pressure message to all stewards on Wednesday (e.g., "How's the data gathering going? Thumbs up, sideways, or down?").

## Philosophy of the Check-in

This is not a micromanagement tool. It is a **practice of collective accountability and mutual support**. It reinforces that stewards are not alone in their task and that small, early clarifications prevent larger problems later. It models the relational capital the dashboard seeks to measure.
