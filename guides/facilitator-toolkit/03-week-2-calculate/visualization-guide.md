# Visualization Guide: Creating the Regeneration Flower

## Purpose & Principles

Your task is to create the primary visual for the council: the **Regeneration Flower**. This is not just a chart; it is a *sacred object* for the community's reflection. Strive for **clarity, accuracy, and beauty**.

**Key Principle:** The visualization should make the state of the system intuitively graspable within seconds.

## Recommended Method: Digital Radar Chart

This is the most accessible and reproducible method.

### Tools:
- **Google Sheets:** Simple, shareable, good for collaboration.
- **Microsoft Excel:** Similar functionality.
- **Python with Matplotlib/Plotly:** For automated scripts (see dashboard scripts).
- **Online chart tools** (e.g., Datawrapper, Canva): For polished design.

### Step-by-Step (Google Sheets/Excel):
1.  **Set Up Data:** Create a table with two columns.
    - Column A: `Domain` (Politics, Economics, Culture, Ecology, Spirituality).
    - Column B: `Score` (your calculated Domain Scores, 1-10).
2.  **Insert Chart:** Highlight the data. Go to *Insert > Chart*.
3.  **Select Chart Type:** In the Chart Editor, choose **"Radar Chart"** (may be called "Spider Chart").
4.  **Customize for Clarity:**
    - **Scale:** Set the radial axis maximum value to **10**.
    - **Gridlines:** Use subtle gridlines (e.g., at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).
    - **Fill Color:** Use a translucent, pleasant fill color (e.g., light green, soft blue) for the shape.
    - **Line & Points:** Use a slightly darker, solid line for the shape's edge. Mark the five data points clearly.
5.  **Add Context:** Below or beside the chart, always display:
    - The **Alpha (α) Coefficient** prominently.
    - A small key reminding viewers of the five domains.

**🔹 Pro-Tip:** Save last cycle's Flower. Place the new and old Flower side-by-side to show progress over time.

## Low-Tech Pathway: Hand-Drawn Flower

For communities meeting offline or preferring tactile objects, a hand-drawn flower is powerful.

### Materials:
Large paper (poster board), ruler, protractor, compass, markers/colored pencils.

### Instructions:
1.  **Draw the Axes:** Draw a circle. Use a protractor to mark five equally spaced points (72° apart) around the circle. Label them: Politics, Economics, Culture, Ecology, Spirituality. Draw a line from the center to each point.
2.  **Create the Scale:** On each axis, mark 10 evenly spaced ticks from the center (0) to the edge (10).
3.  **Plot the Points:** For each domain, mark a point along its axis corresponding to its score (e.g., a score of 7.8 is about 78% of the way to the edge).
4.  **Connect the Dots:** Connect the five points in order to form the Flower shape. Color it in.
5.  **Annotate:** Write the Alpha score and the cycle date prominently on the poster.

**Why this works:** The physical act of drawing the Flower in the meeting space becomes part of the ritual. It is slow, deliberate, and focuses collective attention.

## What to Emphasize When Presenting

When you show the Flower in the Week 3 council:
1.  **Start Simple:** "This shape represents the vitality of our system across five areas."
2.  **Highlight Extremes:** "Our strongest area is **[Domain]**. Our area with the most potential for growth is **[Domain]**."
3.  **Note Symmetry:** "Notice the shape is [balanced / lopsided]. This tells us about the [integration / imbalance] in our development."
4.  **Connect to Alpha:** "This overall shape gives us an Alpha score of **[Value]**, which suggests we are in the **[Proto/Differentiating/Integrated] System** phase."

Avoid overloading the visual with numbers. The shape itself is the primary object of contemplation.
