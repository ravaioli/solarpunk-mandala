# In-Person Logistics: Cultivating the Container

## Introduction

This section covers the physical and logistical preparation for hosting an in-person Arena session or solarpunk gathering. A well-prepared container—the space, nourishment, and materials—allows the group's energy to flow toward creativity and connection, not basic needs.

## Core Philosophy

Our logistics are an embodiment of our values: **Care, Sustainability, and Practical Beauty.** Every choice, from the food we serve to the chairs we sit on, is part of the message.

## Guides in This Section

2.  **[Venue & Setup Checklist](./02-venue-checklist.md)** – How to prepare the physical space to support collaboration, accessibility, and inspiration.

## The Facilitator's Mindset

You are a host, not just a facilitator. Your role extends to creating an environment where every participant feels:
- **Physically comfortable** (well-fed, at the right temperature, able to move)
- **Psychologically safe** (welcomed, included, able to contribute)
- **Ethically aligned** (the space reflects the solarpunk values we're discussing)
- **Inspirationally supported** (surrounded by beauty, nature, and thoughtful design)

This logistical work is invisible when done well, but fundamental to the success of any gathering.

## A Note on Scale & Resources

The principles here apply whether you're hosting in a community garden, a borrowed office, or a rented hall. Adapt based on your means, but hold true to the core values: care for people and planet through thoughtful preparation.
