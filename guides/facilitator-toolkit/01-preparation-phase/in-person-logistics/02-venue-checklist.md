# Venue & Setup Checklist: Crafting the Physical Container

## Introduction

The space where we gather becomes a character in our collaboration. It can either support or hinder the work. This checklist helps you prepare a venue that embodies solarpunk principles: **accessible, regenerative, beautiful, and functional.**

## Pre-Event: Selection & Planning

### 📍 **Space Selection Criteria**
*   [ ] **Accessibility:** Step-free entry, accessible restrooms, near public transit. Consider mobility, visual, and auditory needs.
*   [ ] **Size & Flow:** Room for a main circle, breakout spaces, and movement. Not too cramped, not cavernous.
*   [ ] **Natural Elements:** Prioritize spaces with natural light, views of nature, or access to an outdoor area.
*   [ ] **Sustainability Ethos:** Preference for community centers, co-ops, libraries, or green-certified venues.
*   [ ] **Cost & Community:** Can we afford it? Does renting here support a local/community initiative?
*   [ ] **Acoustics:** Can people hear each other without shouting? Is it insulated from external noise?

### 📋 **Booking & Agreements**
*   [ ] Confirm booking dates, times, and access hours (include setup/cleanup time).
*   [ ] Understand venue rules on: food/drink, decorations, noise, waste disposal.
*   [ ] Obtain necessary permits or insurance if required.
*   [ ] Confirm contact person for day-of issues.

## Event Setup: Creating the Environment

### 🪑 **Furniture & Layout**
*   [ ] **Seating:** Arrange in a circle or semi-circle to encourage eye contact and equal participation. Ensure chairs are comfortable.
*   [ ] **Flexibility:** Have movable furniture for breakout groups. Consider floor cushions, standing options.
*   [ ] **Surfaces:** Tables for writing, placing drinks, or collaborative activities.
*   [ ] **Flow:** Create clear pathways. Designate areas for: main circle, food/drink, materials, quiet reflection.

### 🌿 **Sensory & Aesthetic Elements**
*   [ ] **Light:** Maximize natural light. Have soft, warm artificial light for evenings. Avoid harsh fluorescents.
*   [ ] **Greenery:** Bring plants! They improve air quality and mood.
*   [ ] **Visual Inspiration:** Display relevant art, the Solarpunk Mandala itself, or quotes from solarpunk literature.
*   [ ] **Acoustics:** Test sound. Have a microphone for large groups if needed. Consider quiet background music for arrivals/breaks.
*   [ ] **Temperature:** Ensure the room is well-ventilated. Have fans or heaters available if you can't control the thermostat.
*   [ ] **Scent:** Opt for fresh air. If using scents, choose mild, natural options (like a single essential oil diffuser) and ensure the space is well-ventilated.

### 🛠️ **Materials & Tools**
*   [ ] **Facilitation Basics:**
    *   [ ] Whiteboard, flip chart, or large paper pads with plenty of markers (low-odor, various colors).
    *   [ ] Projector, screen, and necessary adapters for laptops.
    *   [ ] Speakers for music or video sound.
*   [ ] **Solarpunk Toolkit:**
    *   [ ] Reusable notebooks or seed paper for notes.
    *   [ ] A "library" of relevant books, zines, or artifacts for inspiration.
    *   [ ] Natural materials for activities (clay, leaves, stones).
    *   [ ] A "maker corner" with basic craft supplies.
*   [ ] **Participant Comfort:**
    *   [ ] Fidget objects (smooth stones, textile scraps).
    *   [ ] Blankets or shawls if the space might be cool.
    *   [ ] Water stations (see Nourishment Guide).

### 🚨 **Safety & Contingency**
*   [ ] **Emergency Preparedness:**
    *   [ ] Know location of fire exits, extinguishers, and first-aid kit.
    *   [ ] Have a list of emergency contacts (venue, local hospital).
    *   [ ] Share emergency info with participants at the start.
*   [ ] **Inclusion & Care:**
    *   [ ] Clearly label any potential allergens in food (see Nourishment Guide).
    *   [ ] Have a quiet, low-stimulation space available for anyone who needs a sensory break.
    *   [ ] Ensure gender-neutral restrooms are available or clearly signposted.
*   [ ] **Technical Backup:**
    *   [ ] Extension cords and power strips.
    *   [ ] Backup laptop and presentation files on a USB drive.
    *   [ ] Basic toolkit (scissors, tape, string).

## During the Event: Stewardship

*   [ ] **Welcome & Orientation:** Point out key areas (restrooms, quiet space, food).
*   [ ] **Energy Monitoring:** Adjust temperature, lighting, and ventilation as needed.
*   [ ] **Space Reconfiguration:** Be ready to rearrange furniture for different activities.
*   [ ] **Waste Streams:** Clearly label compost, recycling, and landfill bins. Model proper disposal.

## Post-Event: Leave-No-Trace & Regeneration

*   [ ] **Cleanup Plan:** Allocate time and assign tasks. "Cleanup as a communal ritual."
*   [ ] **Waste Management:** Properly dispose of all waste streams. Take compost with you if venue doesn't handle it.
*   [ ] **Restoration:** Return the space to its original state or better. Rearrange furniture, clean surfaces.
*   [ ] **Gratitude:** Thank the venue hosts. Leave a small thank-you note or a plant if appropriate.
*   [ ] **Feedback:** Note what worked and what didn't for future reference.

## Quick-Setup Essentials (For Pop-Up Events)

If you're in a borrowed space with limited time, focus on these:
1.  **Circle of Chairs** – The fundamental container.
2.  **Hydration Station** – Water is non-negotiable.
3.  **Writing Surface** – A flip chart or whiteboard.
4.  **Greenery** – Even one plant changes the feel.
5.  **Clear Pathways** – For safety and flow.
