# Scoping Worksheet for Your First Dashboard Cycle

## Purpose of This Worksheet

This worksheet is designed to be completed collaboratively by your initial Stewardship Circle or core team. Its purpose is to make three critical, concrete decisions that will define your pilot project, preventing vagueness and setting you up for a focused, manageable first cycle.

**Complete this before your Launch Meeting or during your first Stewardship Circle gathering.**

## Part 1: The Three Core Scoping Decisions

Discuss and decide on the following three questions. Write your answers clearly where your whole community can see them.

### 1. Temporal Scope: *"When are we doing this?"*
This defines the time boundary of your first measurement cycle.
- **Our First 4-Week Sprint Cycle will run from:** `[Start Date: __/__/____]` to `[End Date: __/__/____]`.
- **Key dates to schedule now:**
    - **Week 3: Ritual of Diagnosis Council Meeting:** `[Tentative Date/Time: ________]`
    - **Week 4: Protocol Selection Meeting:** `[Tentative Date/Time: ________]`

### 2. Community Scope: *"Who is the 'we'?"*
This defines the social boundary of your pilot. For your first cycle, **start smaller and more defined** rather than overly broad.
- [ ] **The entire defined community** (e.g., all residents of Ecovillage Project X).
- [ ] **A specific working group or committee** (e.g., the Land Stewardship Committee, the Welcome Circle).
- [ ] **A neighborhood or physical zone** (e.g., the Hillside Neighborhood Pod).
- [ ] **A project team** (e.g., the team building the new community kitchen).
- **Our pilot 'community' is:** `[Write your choice and specific name here]`

### 3. Focus Scope: *"What are we measuring?"*
This defines the analytical boundary. We recommend **Option A** for a complete first picture.
- [ ] **Option A (Recommended for Cycle 1): Light-Touch Holism.** We will gather the minimum viable data (1-2 metrics) for **all five domains** to generate a complete, if initial, Regeneration Flower. This shows how the parts relate to the whole.
- [ ] **Option B: Deep Dive.** We will focus primarily on **one domain** that feels most urgent or exciting (e.g., **Ecology**). We'll gather richer data for its 4 capitals, while perhaps just collecting stories for the others.

## Part 2: Resource & Capacity Check

### A) People & Skills
- Who will volunteer for the initial **stewardship roles**? (Refer to `role-descriptions.md`).
- Do we have someone comfortable with basic **data handling** (spreadsheets, running a simple script)?
- Do we have a natural **facilitator** for the council meeting?

### B) Tools & Technology
- **Quantitative Data:** Where will we store our numbers? (e.g., a shared spreadsheet, a physical logbook).
- **Qualitative Poll:** Will we use the provided **Google Form**, or a simpler method like a physical ballot box or shared document?
- **Visualization:** How will we create and share the Regeneration Flower? (e.g., a simple online chart tool, a hand-drawn poster).

### C) Community Context
- What **existing rhythms or meetings** can we attach this process to? (e.g., "We'll make the Ritual of Diagnosis the first item in our monthly full-circle meeting.").
- Are there any current **conflicts or sensitivities** we should be aware of that this process might touch? How can we navigate them with care?

## Part 3: Success & Learning Goals for Cycle 1

Forget about a "high score." Define success for your pilot as learning and completion.

**By the end of our first 4-week cycle, we will consider it a successful experiment if we have:**
- [ ] Held a clear launch conversation with our defined community.
- [ ] Gathered some data and stories from all (or our chosen) domains.
- [ ] Generated our first Regeneration Flower and Alpha score.
- [ ] Held a Ritual of Diagnosis meeting to discuss what we see.
- [ ] Made a collective decision about whether and how to continue.

## Next Steps

1.  **Schedule your first Stewardship Circle meeting** to complete this worksheet together.
2.  **Fill out your decisions** in a shared, visible place.
3.  **Proceed to the `02-week-1-gather/` resources** to begin executing your plan.

**Remember:** This worksheet is a living document. Your scoping decisions can and should evolve after your first cycle based on what you learn.
