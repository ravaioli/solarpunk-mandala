# Cube Description Cards

## Purpose of These Cards

These cards describe common "cubes"—systemic patterns of contraction and rigidity—that communities may diagnose. They are not labels of failure, but **maps of familiar territory**. Identifying a cube provides clarity and direction for choosing a liberating protocol.

**How to Use:** Print and display these during the Ritual of Diagnosis (Step 6) or share them digitally. They give the community a common language for what they are sensing.

### 🧱 **The Productivity Cube**
*"Worth is measured by output."*

**Core Contraction:** The community's value, and often individual self-worth, becomes tied to measurable production, task completion, and visible busyness. "Being" is subordinate to "doing."

**Manifests As:**
*   **In the Dashboard:** High **Productive Capital**, but low **Convivial** (time poverty) and **Presence Capital**.
*   **In Culture:** Burnout, guilt over rest, meetings that are only for reporting, difficulty celebrating without framing it as a "break."
*   **Key Question:** *"Are we human beings or human doings?"*

**What It Craves to Become:** Rhythm, Sabbatical, Right Livelihood, Play.

### 🔄 **The Transaction Cube**
*"Relationships are exchanges."*

**Core Contraction:** Social and ecological relationships are reduced to transactions—tit-for-tat, quantified reciprocity, or cost-benefit analysis. Trust is conditional. The gift economy atrophies.

**Manifests As:**
*   **In the Dashboard:** Low **Relational** and **Reciprocity Capital**. Possibly high **Administrative Capital** (overly procedural).
*   **In Culture:** A sense of score-keeping, hesitation to ask for help, conflict seen as breach of contract rather than injury to relationship.
*   **Key Question:** *"What is the price of this, and what do I get in return?"*

**What It Craves to Become:** Unconditional Regard, Gift Logic, Generosity, Conflict as Compost.

### 🧩 **The Separation Cube**
*"We are apart from nature and each other."*

**Core Contraction:** A felt sense of disconnection and alienation. This can be human-from-nature, individual-from-community, or mind-from-body. Leads to a lack of felt responsibility and belonging.

**Manifests As:**
*   **In the Dashboard:** Low **Interbeing**, **Biophilic**, and **Identity Capital**.
*   **In Culture:** Loneliness even in groups, littering or neglect of commons, difficulty feeling collective emotion or purpose.
*   **Key Question:** *"Am I alone in this?"*

**What It Craves to Become:** Interconnection, Biophilia, Communal Ritual, Embodied Practice.

### 🏛️ **The Control Cube**
*"Order must be imposed from above."*

**Core Contraction:** Distrust in emergent, distributed intelligence leads to over-reliance on hierarchy, top-down planning, and rigid rules. Spontaneity and innovation are seen as threats to stability.

**Manifests As:**
*   **In the Dashboard:** High **Administrative Capital**, but low **Civic**, **Wisdom**, and **Relational Capital**.
*   **In Culture:** Bureaucratic slowdown, permission-seeking, risk aversion, suppressed dissent.
*   **Key Question:** *"Who's in charge, and what are the rules?"*

**What It Craves to Become:** Distributed Trust, Emergent Strategy, Consent-based Decision Making.

**Remember:** A community may see shades of several cubes. The ritual's goal is to identify the **primary, root pattern** whose softening would create the most systemic release.
