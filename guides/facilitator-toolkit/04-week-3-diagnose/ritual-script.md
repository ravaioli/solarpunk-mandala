# Ritual of Diagnosis: Facilitator's Script

## Purpose & Preparation

This script guides you through facilitating the **Ritual of Diagnosis**, the pivotal moment where data transforms into collective wisdom and choice. Your role is to steward a process, not lead a debate. Prepare by reviewing the Regeneration Flower, Alpha score, and narrative themes from the poll.

**Time:** 90-120 minutes
**Materials Needed:** Projected Regeneration Flower, printed/list of key narrative themes, blank paper/pens, talking piece (optional), timer.
**Sacred Intent:** To move from *What is?* to *What is asking to be released?*

## The Ritual Script

### Phase 1: Arrival & Opening (10 minutes)

**1. Welcome & Centering (5 min)**
*"Welcome, everyone. Thank you for being here for this Ritual of Diagnosis. We are here not to problem-solve, but to listen—to the data, to each other, and to the deeper patterns within our community system.*
*Let's begin with a minute of silence. Feel your feet on the ground. Release the day's distractions. We arrive together."* (Hold silence).

**2. Framing the Purpose (5 min)**
*"Over the past weeks, we've gathered numbers and stories. Now, we synthesize. Our goal tonight is singular: to identify the one primary, rigid pattern—what we call a 'cube'—that, if softened or dissolved, would allow for the greatest flow of life and energy in our community.*
*We'll observe our Flower, hear the themes from our stories, and sense together. My role is to hold the process; your role is to speak from your heart and listen from your curiosity."*

### Phase 2: Observation & Sensing (25 minutes)

**3. Presenting the Data (10 min)**
1.  **Display the Regeneration Flower.** *"First, let's simply observe. This is a picture of our system's vitality across five domains. Notice its shape, its symmetry, its strong and weak points."* (Allow quiet looking).
2.  **Share the Alpha (α) Coefficient.** *"Our holistic vitality score is α = [Value]. This places us in the **[Proto/Differentiating/Integrated] System** phase."*
3.  **Read the Narrative Themes.** *"Behind these numbers are our lived experiences. Here are the key themes that emerged from your anonymous poll responses:"* (Read 3-5 key themes verbatim, e.g., "Many shared a feeling of time scarcity," "Several noted joy in the new garden").

**4. Silent Reflection & Journaling (5 min)**
*"Now, take a few minutes of silence with these questions. Jot down notes if you wish:*
*   *What in this data resonates with your own experience?*
*   *What surprises you or draws your curiosity?*
*   *Where do you feel a sense of flow or aliveness? Where do you feel contraction or stiffness?"*

**5. Initial Shared Sensing (10 min)**
*"Let's do a first round of sharing. We're not analyzing yet, just speaking what we sense. Using a talking piece [or raised hands], please share one word, one phrase, or one brief observation that arose for you."* (Facilitator listens, may lightly reflect back themes like "I hear both care and fatigue," but does not engage discussion).

### Phase 3: Diagnosis & Naming the Cube (40 minutes)

**6. Introducing the "Cubes" (5 min)**
*"Our framework suggests that systemic contractions often crystallize into recognizable patterns we call 'cubes.' They are metaphors for rigid ways of thinking and being. Tonight, we ask: which cube is most present for us?"*
**Briefly introduce the three most relevant cubes** (see `cube-description-cards.md`). For example: *"Is it the **Productivity Cube**, where worth is tied to output? The **Transaction Cube**, where relationships feel like exchanges? Or the **Separation Cube**, where we feel disconnected from nature and each other?"*

**7. Small Group Dialogues (20 min)**
*"Now, break into groups of 3-4. Discuss: Based on our data and our sensing, which cube feels most resonant as the primary pattern holding us back? Use the description cards as a reference. Appoint a scribe to note key reasons."*

**8. Group Reports & Emerging Picture (10 min)**
*"Let's hear from each group. Just the name of the cube you're leaning toward and one core reason."* (Facilitator writes cube names on a board and tallys).

**9. Converging & Finalizing (5 min)**
*"Looking at this landscape, I'm hearing a strong leaning toward the **[Cube Name]**. Before we finalize, let's take 30 seconds of silence to sense into this. Does naming the **[Cube Name]** as our primary pattern feel true to the group?"* (Sense the room). *"If it feels congruent, I propose we accept the diagnosis of the **[Cube Name]**."* (Seek explicit verbal or nonverbal consensus).

### Phase 4: Closing & Transition (10 minutes)

**10. Acknowledgment & Closing the Ritual (5 min)**
*"We have done meaningful work tonight. We have moved from data to diagnosis. We have named the **[Cube Name]** as the pattern we will work with. Let's honor this by taking one more minute of silence, holding this intention."* (Hold silence).

**11. Transition to Action (5 min)**
*"This diagnosis is not an end, but a beginning. It gives us clarity for **Week 4**, where we will choose a specific protocol or experiment to gently 'dissolve' this cube. Thank you for your deep listening and courage."*

**🔹 Immediate After-Action:** Record the diagnosed cube and any key notes in your community log.
