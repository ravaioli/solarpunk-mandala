# Experiment Canvas

## Purpose of This Canvas

This canvas is used to design your chosen protocol as a **rigorous yet adaptive learning experiment**. Filling it out transforms a good idea into an actionable plan with clear assumptions, making your community's learning explicit. Complete this as a council in **Week 4**.

## The Canvas

### 1. Core Hypothesis
*If we...*
**"[State the core action of your chosen protocol, e.g., institute a mandatory 4-hour 'useless afternoon' every Sunday where productive work is forbidden]"**

*...then we expect to see...*
**"[Describe the change in community dynamics or capitals, e.g., a rise in Convivial Capital scores, more spontaneous play, and narratives of time abundance in the next poll]"**

*because...*
**"[Explain the causal logic, e.g., by forcibly decoupling time from production, we disrupt the underlying assumption that worth comes from output, allowing space for being and connection.]"**

### 2. Experiment Design

**What will we actually DO? (The Intervention)**
- **Key Actions:** *[List 3-5 concrete, who-does-what-by-when tasks.]*
    1.
    2.
    3.
- **Duration:** This experiment will run for **one full 4-week dashboard cycle** (from the next Week 1 to the next Week 4).

**How will we PAY ATTENTION? (The Observation)**
- **Qualitative Signals:** What will we look for in daily life? *[e.g., "Are people laughing more on Mondays? Do conversations shift from 'what did you get done?' to 'what did you experience?'"]*
- **Quantitative Signals:** What might change in our next dashboard scores? *[e.g., "We expect the Convivial Capital score to rise by at least 1 point. We expect the 'time scarcity' narrative theme to reduce in the poll."]*

### 3. Roles & Resources

**Who is responsible?**
- **Primary Steward(s):** *[Name(s)]* - Ensures the experiment launches and is remembered.
- **Supporting Roles:** *[e.g., "Communications Link will send weekly reminders."]*

**What do we need?**
- **Resources:** *[e.g., "A shared calendar event, one announcement at circle."]*
- **Potential Obstacles:** *[e.g., "Some may feel anxious or guilty about not working. We need to frame this as a collective courage practice."]*

### 4. Success & Learning

**What does "success" look like?**
*(Frame this as learning, not passing a test.)*
- **Even if our scores don't move, we will have learned something valuable if...** *[e.g., "...we have a richer conversation about why the pattern is so sticky."]*
- **We will know the experiment is having a *positive* effect if...** *[e.g., "...at least two people share unsolicited stories of joy from their 'useless' time."]*

**How will we close the learning loop?**
- In the **next Ritual of Diagnosis** (in 4 weeks), we will dedicate 15 minutes to reviewing this canvas and asking: **"What did this experiment reveal about our cube and our community?"**

## Finalized Experiment Plan

**Protocol Name:** *[e.g., Useless Sunday Afternoon Trial]*
**Steward:** *[Name]*
**Start Date:** *[Date of next Week 1]*
**Check-in Date:** *[Date of next Week 3/4]*

**By agreeing to this canvas, we commit to trying this experiment with open minds and curiosity, accepting all outcomes as valuable data about our system.**

**Council Approval:** _________________________________________
*Signed by the Dashboard Coordinator or council consensus.*
