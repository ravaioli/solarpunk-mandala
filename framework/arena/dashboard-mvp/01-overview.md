# The Regenerative Capital Dashboard: Overview

## Purpose & Vision

The Regenerative Capital Dashboard is a **cybernetic tool for conscious transition**. It moves beyond measuring mere financial transaction (GDP) to track the holistic vitality of a community or bioregion. Its core purpose is to make visible the health of the systems that enable true flourishing, guided by the principles of the **Solarpunk Mandala** and the **Conscious Regeneration Economy (CRE)**.

This dashboard translates the Mandala's theoretical framework—with its focus on **Ecological Regeneration, Social Cohesion, Consciousness, Appropriate Technology, and Beauty**—into a measurable, feedback-responsive practice. It serves as a communal "mirror" and "compass."

## Core Concept: The 5+1 Display

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) dashboard is built around a "5+1" display model that balances simplicity with diagnostic power:

1.  **The Five Domain Scorecards:** These track health across the five core circles of community life, each analyzed through four specific types of capital (20 capitals total).
2.  **The One Diagnostic Visualization:** This synthesizes the scorecard data into an intuitive, actionable shape.

### 1. The Regeneration Flower (Primary Diagnostic)

The **Regeneration Flower** is a hexagonal radar chart where each vertex represents one of the five domains. The community's aggregate score for each domain plots a point, and connecting these points creates a unique shape.

*   **A small, lopsided shape** indicates a struggling, imbalanced system.
*   **A large, symmetrical shape** indicates robust, balanced regeneration.
*   **The communal goal** is to collaboratively "grow and round out the flower" with each assessment cycle.

### 2. The Five Domain & Capital Framework

The dashboard assesses vitality through five domains, each containing four capital types. This 5x4 structure mirrors the Mandala's own tesseract geometry, creating a microcosm of the whole within each part.

| Domain | Core Question | Capital Types (The Four Axes Within) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **☀️ Politics** | Is our governance wise, trusted, and relational? | Relational, Administrative, Civic, Wisdom |
| **📉 Economics** | Are our means of livelihood and exchange convivial & just? | Productive, Reciprocity, Knowledge, Convivial |
| **🪢 Culture** | Do our stories, art, and rituals create meaning & beauty? | Narrative, Aesthetic, Ritual, Identity |
| **🌱 Ecology** | Is our relationship with the living world regenerative? | Regenerative, Adaptive, Biophilic, Stewardship |
| **✴️ Spirituality** | Are we cultivating presence, purpose, and interconnection? | Presence, Contemplative, Purpose, Interbeing |

*For detailed definitions and metrics for all 20 capitals, see [02-capital-framework.md](./02-capital-framework.md).*

## Key Metrics: The Alpha (α) Coefficient

The **Alpha Coefficient** is a single, synthesized metric (on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0) representing the system's **holistic vitality**. It is calculated from the Regeneration Flower:

`α = (F / F_max) * B`

*   **F** = The actual surface area of the community's Regeneration Flower.
*   **F_max** = The maximum possible area if all domains scored perfectly.
*   **B** = A **Balance Penalty (0.8 - 1.0)** that reduces the score if the flower is lopsided, enforcing holistic development.

**Interpretation:**
*   **α < 0.3:** **Proto-System.** Focus on strengthening foundational capitals.
*   **0.3 ≤ α < 0.7:** **Differentiating System.** Focus on integrating connections between domains.
*   **α ≥ 0.7:** **Integrated System.** Focus on wisdom and dynamic balance.

## Implementation Rhythm: The 4-Week Sprint Cycle

The dashboard is designed to be used in a recurring, ritualistic cycle that turns measurement into learning and action.

| Week | Phase | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1** | **Gather & Input** | Collect quantitative data from community logs and launch the qualitative [Community Poll](./04-poll-questions.md). |
| **Week 2** | **Calculate & Visualize** | Process data, calculate domain scores and α, and update the Regeneration Flower visualization. |
| **Week 3** | **Ritual of Diagnosis** | The community gathers in a **Council of the Whole** to observe the Flower, reflect on narrative data, and ask: **"Which rigid pattern ('cube') must be dissolved to allow greater flow?"** |
| **Week 4** | **Prescribe & Act** | Based on the diagnosis, the council selects a protocol from the Mandala's appendices to experiment with in the next cycle (e.g., a Right Livelihood Audit, a new communal ritual). |

## Philosophical Grounding

This tool is more than software; it is a **technology of consciousness**. By collectively defining, measuring, and attending to these 20 forms of capital, a community performs a ritual that reinforces the reality it seeks to measure. The dashboard operationalizes key Mandala principles:

*   **Systems Cybernetics:** It creates a closed feedback loop for social learning.
*   **Multiple Intelligences:** It values and measures forms of intelligence beyond the logical-mathematical (e.g., ecological, kinesthetic, interpersonal).
*   **The Four Ethical Axes:** Every capital and metric can be evaluated through the lenses of the **Unitive, Beautiful, Just, and True**.
