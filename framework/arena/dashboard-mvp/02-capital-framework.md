# The Regenerative Capital Framework: Definitions & Metrics

## Introduction to the 20 Capitals

This document defines the 20 forms of capital that form the core measurement units of the Regenerative Capital Dashboard. Each capital represents a **stock of value** that can be cultivated, depleted, or regenerated within a community or bioregion.

The framework is structured across **five domains** (Ekistics Circles), each containing **four capitals**. This 5x4 structure is a direct expression of the Mandala's tesseract geometry, where the four internal axes (Structure, Process, Pattern, Consciousness) manifest uniquely within each domain.

## Capital Definitions & Measurement

The following table provides the operational definition, core metrics, and primary data sources for each capital. **Q** denotes a Quantitative metric; **Ql** denotes a Qualitative metric gathered via the [community poll](../04-poll-questions.md).

## Integration with the Mandala's Core Geometry

The 20 capitals are not a random list but a structured manifestation of the Mandala's fourfold (tesseract) logic within each domain. Every domain contains a microcosm of the whole:

1.  **Structure/Container Capital** (e.g., *Regenerative, Productive, Aesthetic*): The tangible, measurable forms and foundations.
2.  **Process/Exchange Capital** (e.g., *Adaptive, Reciprocity, Ritual*): The flows, relationships, and dynamic activities.
3.  **Pattern/Information Capital** (e.g., *Biophilic, Knowledge, Narrative*): The codes, stories, designs, and blueprints that guide action.
4.  **Consciousness/Quality Capital** (e.g., *Stewardship, Convivial, Interbeing*): The inner awareness, state, or ethic that animates the system.

This pattern means that diagnosing a weakness in, for example, a *Consciousness-type* capital (like **Stewardship**) likely requires interventions that address inner values and awareness, not just outer rules.

## Diagnostic Pathways: From Measurement to Protocol

A primary function of this framework is to enable the **Ritual of Diagnosis**. A consistently low score in a capital points not just to a problem, but to a specific "cube" (rigid pattern) to dissolve and suggests a family of interventions.

*   **Example Diagnosis (Low Convivial Capital):** Points to a **"Productivity Cube"**—an over-identification with output. A prescribed protocol might be the **"Right Livelihood Audit"** from the Mandala's appendices, or the experimental implementation of a **6-hour workday**.
*   **Example Diagnosis (Low Relational Capital):** Points to a **"Transaction Cube"**—relationships reduced to exchange. A prescribed protocol might be the initiation of **"Deep Listening Circles"** or the adoption of a **"Conflict as Compost"** ritual framework.

For the full diagnostic procedure, see the [Implementation Guide](../05-implementation-guide.md).
