## Overview
Creating societies where well-being replaces growth. Cultivates collective liberation through shared vision—freedom as interdependence, not escape.

## Core Concepts
- **Radically Democratic**: Real collective self-determination
- **Sufficient Flourishing**: Wealth that creates more life
- **Democracy of Meanings**: Co-creation of significance
- **Generational Care**: Seven generation stewardship

## Self-Enquiry
What would a Radically Democratic system look like in my community, and how would practicing Generational Care shift my understanding of what constitutes Sufficient Flourishing for all?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Do systems become healthier through use?
2. Does participation increase collective intelligence?
3. Are future generations valued in present decisions?

## Related Variables
- Multi-generational planning metrics
- Democratic participation quality indexes
- Regenerative economic indicators

## Organ: The Collective Imagination
**Capacity**: Prefigurative Vision

## Rationale
To make the desired future so compelling and tangible that it out-competes the dystopian default.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Community storytelling, art, design fictions, and building functional prototypes of the future.

## Defense/Propagation
**Desire Mapping**: Cultivating shared longing for relational wealth over material accumulation.

## Tetrad Central Claim
Generative DNA: Systems designed for radical democracy, sufficient flourishing, and intergenerational care as inherent rights rather than aspirational goals.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Progress/The Future
- **ENHANCES**: Community resilience; qualitative well-being; aesthetic-ecological integration; post-capitalist value
- **OBSOLESCES**: Infinite growth ideology; brittle infrastructure; dystopian default future
- **RETRIEVES**: Commons ethos; craft and artisanry augmented with appropriate technology
- **REVERSES INTO**: Vibrant, desirable simplicity experienced as abundance of time, connection, and purpose

## Partial Diagnosis
Generative DNA: Systems designed for radical democracy, sufficient flourishing, and intergenerational care as inherent rights rather than aspirational goals.

## Case Study
Transition Towns: Beginning in Totnes, England, Transition Towns demonstrate solarpunk aspirations through grassroots democratic organizing, focus on community resilience and sufficient rather than maximum flourishing, celebration of diverse cultural meanings of prosperity, and explicit care for generational sustainability.

## Key Literature
**"A Psalm for the Wild-Built"** by Becky Chambers (2021): Chambers's novella exemplifies SolarPunk's vision of radically democratic communities that prioritize sufficient flourishing over endless growth, featuring diverse meanings of success and deep care for future generations.
