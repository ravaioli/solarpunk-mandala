# Extractive Temporality

**Meta-Narrative**: 🦠 Necrocene  
**Logic**: Measured Outcomes  
**Category**: The Tyranny of the Clock  
**Emoji**: ⌚

## Overview
Time is linear, finite, and hostile - a resource to be exploited for immediate gain. Sacrifices the future for present gain—hoarding short-term profit by externalizing intergenerational cost.

## Core Concepts
- **Short-termism**: Election cycles trump generational thinking; crisis governance prevents long-term planning
- **Quarterly Capitalism**: Future value discounted to near-zero; intergenerational theft institutionalized
- **Accelerated Amnesia**: Cultural memory erased by novelty; trends replace traditions
- **Temporal Externalization**: Costs pushed to future generations; slow environmental damage ignored

## Self-Enquiry
How does my experience of time keep me trapped in emergency thinking, preventing me from acting for the long-term?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Does the system sacrifice future viability for present convenience?
2. Are decisions made against electoral or quarterly cycles rather than ecological or civilizational timeframes?
3. Does the system accelerate itself toward collapse?
