## Overview
System that profits from managing and producing suffering/death. Accumulates wealth by externalizing death—profiting from war, pollution, and care deficits while hoarding surplus.

## Core Concepts
- **Necropolitics**: Who gets to live or die
- **Necroeconomics**: Wealth from destruction
- **Necromancy**: Reviving dead ideologies
- **Necropolis**: Cities as death-worlds

## Self-Enquiry
In what ways do I participate in an economic system (Necroeconomics) that relies on the creation of "death-worlds" (Necropolis)—sacrifice zones for people and planet—and how is this reality disguised or justified through modern Necromancy (e.g., PR, greenwashing)?

## Diagnostic Questions
1. Does the system generate wealth from harm (e.g., pollution, disease)?
2. Are life-sustaining activities undervalued compared to destructive ones?
3. Is destruction masked as "creative disruption"?

## Related Variables
- Profit margins from extractive industries
- Environmental externalities costs
- Life expectancy vs. wealth concentration

## Organ: The Liver
**Capacity**: Regeneration

## Rationale
To create a permanent crisis economy where destruction becomes profitable.

## Extraction/Cultivation
Destruction-reconstruction cycles; testing weapons systems; humanitarian aid industry; surveillance tech exports.

## Defense/Propagation
**Crisis Capitalism**: Positioning "Our" companies as global experts in "counter-terrorism" and "homeland security."

## Tetrad Central Claim
Vampire Economics: System profits from death and destruction, extracting value from life processes and treating them as expendable.

## Tetrad Analysis
- **Object of Perception**: Value/Wealth
- **ENHANCES**: Efficiency in resource extraction; short-term profit maximization; crisis capitalism
- **OBSOLESCES**: Life-sustaining economies; care work; regenerative practices; ethical boundaries
- **RETRIEVES**: Feudal exploitation and sacrifice zones, but at industrial scale
- **REVERSES INTO**: System cannibalizes its own life support systems; wealth becomes increasingly abstract and detached from real value

## Partial Diagnosis
Vampire Economics: System profits from death and destruction, extracting value from life processes and treating them as expendable.

## Case Study
Gaza Strip as Necropolitical Laboratory (2000s-present): Mbembe's analysis of how territorial fragmentation creates conditions where populations exist in states of "living death" - spatially separated, surveilled, and subject to periodic destruction while being economically necessary for the occupying power.

## Key Literature
**"Necropolitics"** by Achille Mbembe (2019): Mbembe's seminal work explores the contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power of death, analyzing how specific bodies are forced to remain in suspended states between life and death. The book examines how necropower operates through racism and creates "living dead" populations under extreme precarious conditions.
