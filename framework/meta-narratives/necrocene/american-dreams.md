## Case Study
Ford Model T and Consumer Democracy (1910s-1920s): The introduction of affordable automobiles represents a pivotal moment when American Dreams of consumer culture penetrated rural and isolated areas. This demonstrates how "democracy of goods" was marketed as universal prosperity while creating new dependencies on industrial systems, debt structures, and resource extraction.

## Key Literature
**"The Myth of the American Dream: Reflections on Affluence, Autonomy, Safety, and Power"** by D.L. Mayfield (2020): This book directly deconstructs the four pillars of the American Dream myth, revealing how these values function as an empire that exploits and discards marginalized communities. Mayfield examines how consumerist promises of freedom and abundance serve to mask systemic inequalities and extractive capitalism.
