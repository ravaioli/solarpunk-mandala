# A. Ontological Ground

Purpose
- Define the entities, relationships, and primitives that the Solarpunk Mandala project treats as "real".
- Provide vocabulary for later design and tooling work.

Sections
- Key entities (e.g., nodes, modules, patterns)
- Relationships and constraints
- Example use-cases showing how entities interact

Notes
- Keep definitions concise and link to examples in /03_tools_prompts when relevant.
