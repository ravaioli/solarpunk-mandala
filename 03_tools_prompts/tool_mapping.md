# Tool-Specific Strength Mapping

Purpose
- Map tools (e.g., Python, GPT-style models, vector editors) to tasks where they excel and where they should be avoided.

Template mapping
- Tool: e.g., "Python (Pillow, numpy)"  
  - Strengths: deterministic image processing, repeatable batch transforms  
  - Weaknesses: creative layout decisions without human oversight

- Tool: "LLMs (Gemini / GPT)"  
  - Strengths: ideation, prompt-driven variations, documentation drafting  
  - Weaknesses: hallucination of sources, deterministic reproducibility

How to use
- Keep short examples of prompts and micro-benchmarks for each tool.
