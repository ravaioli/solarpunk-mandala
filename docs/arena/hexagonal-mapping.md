# Hexagonal Connection Mapping Guide

## Introduction
The Hexagonal Connection Map is a practical tool for visualizing and analyzing the 24 interfaces between Ekistics Elements and Circles Domains. By mapping these connections as a honeycomb structure, communities can see patterns of strength and weakness in their regenerative systems.

## Why Hexagonal?
Nature uses hexagonal patterns for optimal efficiency:
- **Bees** build hexagonal honeycombs for maximum storage with minimal wax
- **Snowflakes** form hexagonal crystals that distribute stress evenly
- **Basalt columns** cool into hexagonal shapes that maximize structural integrity

This biomimetic approach honors the intelligence of natural systems while providing a practical framework for community design.

## Materials Needed
- Large paper or whiteboard (minimum 3'x3')
- Hexagonal grid template (provided below)
- Colored markers (blue for Soteriological, green for Axiological, red for Relational, purple for Temporal)
- Sticky notes for annotations
- Camera for documentation

## Step-by-Step Mapping Process

### 1. Create the Grid
[Insert hexagonal grid template - 7 cells: 1 center + 6 surrounding]

**Center Cell**: Label as "Community Heart"  
**Surrounding Cells**: Label each with one Ekistics Element:
- Top: NATURE
- Top right: MAN
- Bottom right: SOCIETY
- Bottom: SHELLS
- Bottom left: NETWORKS
- Top left: CULTURE (representing the integration of all domains)

### 2. Score Each Interface
For each of the 24 interfaces, ask:
1. **Connectivity**: How strongly are these elements connected? (1-5)
2. **Vitality**: How alive and regenerative is this connection? (1-5)
3. **Permeability**: How easily can resources, people, and information flow? (1-5)

Record scores on a separate sheet using this format:
