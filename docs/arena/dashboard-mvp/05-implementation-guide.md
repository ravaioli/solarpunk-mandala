# Implementation Guide: The 4-Week Dashboard Sprint

## Introduction: The Cybernetic Ritual

This guide details the **4-week sprint cycle** for operating the Regenerative Capital Dashboard. This cycle is designed as a **recurring ritual of collective sense-making and action**—a cybernetic feedback loop that turns measurement into learning, and learning into wiser practice.

The goal is not to achieve a "perfect score," but to cultivate a **practice of conscious, adaptive self-creation** for the community.

## The Sprint Cycle: Phase-by-Phase Guide

### 📥 **Week 1: Gather & Input**
*The phase of open perception and data collection.*

**Objective:** To collect both quantitative (Q) and qualitative (Ql) data for all 20 capitals.

| Task | Responsible Party | Actions & Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Collect Quantitative Data** | **Domain Stewards** (teams of 2-3 per domain) | Use the [MVP Scorecards](../03-mvp-scorecards.md) as a checklist. Gather data from logs, audits, and records for each **Q metric**. Compile results in a shared spreadsheet. |
| **2. Launch the Community Poll** | **Facilitator/Culture Steward** | 1. Create or duplicate the [Google Form based on the poll questions](../04-poll-questions.md).<br>2. Announce the poll opening in the community circle.<br>3. Ideally, host a **gathered session** (in-person or virtual) where members complete the poll together, followed by brief shared reflections. |
| **3. Assemble Data Packet** | **Dashboard Coordinator** | Consolidate all **Q data** from stewards and ensure the poll (**Ql data**) closes by the end of Week 1. |

### 🧮 **Week 2: Calculate & Visualize**
*The phase of synthesis and pattern recognition.*

**Objective:** To process raw data into the Domain Scores, Alpha Coefficient, and the Regeneration Flower visualization.

| Task | Responsible Party | Actions & Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Process Poll Results** | **Dashboard Coordinator** | 1. Download poll results.<br>2. For each scaled capital question (Ql), calculate the **community average score** (on the 1-5 scale).<br>3. **Normalize** these Ql averages to a 1-10 scale: `(Ql_average / 5) * 10`. |
| **2. Calculate Capital Scores** | **Dashboard Coordinator** | For each of the 20 capitals:<br>`Capital Score = (Q_normalized + Ql_normalized) / 2`<br>*Follow the specific normalization notes in the [Scorecards](../03-mvp-scorecards.md).* |
| **3. Calculate Domain Scores** | **Dashboard Coordinator** | For each of the five domains:<br>`Domain Score = Average(Capital 1, Capital 2, Capital 3, Capital 4)`<br>This yields **five scores, each from 1-10**. |
| **4. Generate the Regeneration Flower** | **Visual Steward** | 1. Use the five Domain Scores to plot a point on each axis of a **hexagonal radar chart**.<br>2. Connect the points to form the "flower."<br>3. Prominently display this visualization in the community space (physical and digital). |
| **5. Calculate the Alpha (α) Coefficient** | **Dashboard Coordinator** | Use the formula:<br>`α = (F / F_max) * B`<br>- **F** = Actual area of the Regeneration Flower (most chart tools calculate this).<br>- **F_max** = Area if all domain scores were 10.<br>- **B** = **Balance Penalty.** Calculate the standard deviation of the five Domain Scores. If deviation > 2.0, set B=0.8; if between 1.0 and 2.0, set B=0.9; if <1.0, set B=1.0. |

### 🌀 **Week 3: Ritual of Diagnosis**
*The phase of deep inquiry and collective insight.*

**Objective:** To convene the **Council of the Whole**, interpret the data, and identify the core "pattern to dissolve."

**Format:** A dedicated, facilitated 90-120 minute community meeting.

**Agenda:**
1.  **Opening (5 min):** Centering silence and reading of the dashboard's purpose.
2.  **Presentation (15 min):** The Dashboard Coordinator presents:
    *   The new **Regeneration Flower**, visually compared to the last cycle's.
    *   The new **Alpha (α) Coefficient** and its trend.
    *   Key highlights from the **Q data** (e.g., "We planted 15 new trees," "Time bank hours dropped by 20%").
3.  **Narrative Listening (30 min):** The Facilitator shares **anonymous themes** from the *narrative answers* of the poll. This is not about numbers, but about *stories and feelings*. (e.g., "Several people shared stories of feeling time-pressured," "Many noted the joy from the new mural").
4.  **Diagnostic Question (25 min):** The council breaks into small groups to discuss:
    > **"Looking at the Flower's shape, the Alpha score, and the stories we heard—which single 'cube' (rigid, limiting pattern) is most asking to be dissolved to allow for greater life and flow in our community?"**
    *   Is it a **Productivity Cube** (low Convivial Capital)?
    *   Is it a **Transaction Cube** (low Relational Capital)?
    *   Is it a **Separation Cube** (low Interbeing Capital)?
5.  **Synthesis & Proposal (15 min):** Groups report back. The facilitator identifies the **strongest consensus candidate**. The council formally names the "cube" for this cycle (e.g., "We are diagnosing a **Separation Cube**, as seen in low Interbeing and Biophilic scores").

### ⚡ **Week 4: Prescribe & Act**
*The phase of intentional intervention and experiment.*

**Objective:** To select and launch a specific, time-bound protocol to "dissolve" the diagnosed cube.

| Task | Responsible Party | Actions & Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Protocol Selection** | **Council of the Whole** | Based on the diagnosis, choose **one primary protocol** from the Mandala's appendices or community knowledge. Examples:<br>- **For a Productivity Cube:** Implement a "Right Livelihood Audit" or a 1-month trial of a 6-hour workday.<br>- **For a Separation Cube:** Launch a "More-Than-Human Council" ritual or a biweekly nature-connection walk.<br>- **For a Transaction Cube:** Institute "Deep Listening Circles" before decision-making meetings. |
| **2. Experiment Design** | **Action Team** | Form a small team to design the 1-month experiment. Define: **What exactly will we do? Who is responsible? How will we know it's having an effect?** |
| **3. Launch & Communication** | **Communications Steward** | Announce the chosen protocol and experiment to the entire community. Frame it as a **collective learning journey**, not a top-down fix. |
| **4. Prepare for Next Cycle** | **Dashboard Coordinator** | Archive all data and notes from this cycle. Update any metrics in the [Scorecards](../03-mvp-scorecards.md) based on learnings. The cycle begins anew. |

## Troubleshooting & Evolution

*   **Low Poll Participation:** If response rates are low, simplify the poll or host it in person as a mandatory part of a community meal. Emphasize that the narrative data is irreplaceable.
*   **Flat or Declining Alpha Coefficient:** This is a key signal. It suggests the community's interventions are not addressing core issues. Use the Ritual of Diagnosis to go deeper. Consider that the "cube" may be misdiagnosed.
*   **Lopsided Regeneration Flower:** A persistently unbalanced flower is the primary diagnostic tool. The community must consciously choose to invest energy in the lagging domains, even if it feels less "natural" or productive in the short term.
*   **Evolving the Dashboard:** After 3-4 cycles, the community should review the capital definitions and metrics. Do they still reflect what we value? **The dashboard is a living document and should evolve with the community's consciousness.**

## Conclusion

This 4-week sprint is the heartbeat of a learning community. By consistently moving through **Gather → Calculate → Diagnose → Act**, the community builds its capacity for **collective introspection and intentional change**. The dashboard is not the master; it is the servant to the community's unfolding wisdom.
