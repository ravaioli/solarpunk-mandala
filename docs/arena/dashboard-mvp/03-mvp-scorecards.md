# MVP Dashboard: Scorecards & Measurement Guide

## Purpose of the Scorecards

This document provides the integrated measurement table for the Regenerative Capital Dashboard MVP. It is the **primary working document** for community coordinators during the "Gather & Input" phase (Week 1) of the sprint cycle.

Each capital is tracked through a **paired-metric approach**: one **Quantitative (Q)** indicator and one **Qualitative (Ql)** indicator. This balances objective data with subjective, lived experience, honoring the Mandala's integration of the material and the conscious.

## How to Use This Table

1.  **Data Collection Responsibility:** Assign a steward or small team for each domain to be responsible for gathering the **Q** data from logs, audits, and counts.
2.  **Poll Integration:** The **Ql** data is gathered automatically via the monthly [Community Poll](../04-poll-questions.md). The narrative answers provide essential context for the scaled scores.
3.  **Calculating Domain Scores:** Each capital's score is the average of its **Q** and **Ql** metrics (normalized to a 1-10 scale). A domain's overall score (for the Regeneration Flower) is the average of its four capital scores.

## Data Synthesis & Visualization

1.  **Normalize:** Convert all **Q** and **Ql** raw scores to a consistent 1-10 scale using the methods suggested in the "Calculation Notes."
2.  **Average:** For each capital, calculate: `Capital Score = (Q_normalized + Ql_score) / 2`.
3.  **Domain Score:** For each of the five domains, calculate: `Domain Score = Average(Capital 1 Score, Capital 2 Score, Capital 3 Score, Capital 4 Score)`.
4.  **Visualize:** Plot the five **Domain Scores** on the hexagonal radar chart to create the **Regeneration Flower**.
5.  **Calculate Alpha:** Use the formula from the [Overview](../01-overview.md) to compute the holistic **Alpha (α) Coefficient**.

## Sprint Cycle Integration

*   **Week 1 (Gather):** Use this table as a checklist for **Q data** collection. Launch the poll for **Ql data**.
*   **Week 2 (Calculate):** Use the formulas above to compute scores and generate the Flower visual.
*   **Week 3 (Diagnose):** In the council, juxtapose the quantitative scores with **thematic analysis from the poll's narrative answers** (Poll Q2, Q4, Q6, etc.) to understand the "why" behind the numbers.
*   **Week 4 (Act):** Update this table's metrics or targets based on learnings, evolving the dashboard for the next cycle.

**Next Steps:** With measurement defined, the qualitative assessment tool is ready in the [Poll Questions](../04-poll-questions.md), and the full process is outlined in the [Implementation Guide](../05-implementation-guide.md).
