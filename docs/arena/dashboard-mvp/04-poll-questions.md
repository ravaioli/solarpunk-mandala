# Community Poll: Qualitative Assessment Questions

## Purpose & Administration Guide

This document contains the full set of **40 qualitative questions** for the Regenerative Capital Dashboard. These questions are designed to be administered as a **community ritual of self-inquiry** during Week 1 of the 4-week sprint cycle.

### How to Conduct the Poll
*   **Frequency:** Monthly.
*   **Format:** Ideally conducted in a **gathered circle** (physical or virtual). Begin with a minute of collective silence. Members answer privately, then one key insight from their reflections is shared aloud to close the session.
*   **Scaling:** Scaled questions use a **1-5 intuitive spectrum**. The narrative questions are open-ended and provide essential context for the scores.
*   **Connection to Metrics:** The **scaled answers (Ql)** feed directly into the dashboard's capital scores. The **narrative answers** are analyzed for themes during the Week 3 Ritual of Diagnosis.

## Integration with the Dashboard Cycle

*   **Week 1 (Gather):** Administer this poll. The **scaled scores (1-5)** are averaged per capital and normalized to a 1-10 scale for the [MVP Scorecards](../03-mvp-scorecards.md).
*   **Week 3 (Diagnose):** The **narrative answers** are reviewed for themes. They provide the crucial "why" behind the scores, informing the council's diagnostic question: *"Which 'cube' (rigid pattern) must be dissolved?"*

**Next Steps:** With the assessment tool complete, the full operational process is described in the [Implementation Guide](../05-implementation-guide.md).
