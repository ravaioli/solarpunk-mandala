# Role Descriptions for the Dashboard Process

## Introduction: A Philosophy of Rotating Stewardship

These roles are not fixed offices or positions of authority. They are **temporary, rotating stewardships** designed to distribute the work of attention and care across the community. The goal is to prevent burnout in any one person and to cultivate diverse perspectives and skills.

Each role is a commitment for **one 4-week sprint cycle only**. After each cycle, community members are encouraged to reflect, express interest in trying different roles, and pass responsibilities to others. This practice embodies the Solarpunk principles of decentralization, mutual aid, and collaborative intelligence.

## Core Role Overview

| Role | Core Purpose | Key Responsibilities | Approx. Time/Cycle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dashboard Coordinator** | To be the primary steward of the process, ensuring the 4-week rhythm flows smoothly and the community feels held. | • Facilitates the weekly touchpoints (esp. the Ritual of Diagnosis).<br>• Checks in with other stewards.<br>• Ensures data is synthesized for Week 2.<br>• Holds the "big picture" of the cycle. | 4-6 hours |
| **Domain Stewards (1-2 per domain)** | To be the attentive "caretakers" of a specific domain of community life (e.g., Ecology, Culture). | • Gather the **quantitative (Q) data** for their domain's 4 capitals.<br>• Gently remind their affinity group to complete the poll.<br>• Bring a nuanced perspective on their domain to council discussions. | 1-2 hours |
| **Visual Steward** | To translate the community's data into a clear, beautiful, and honest visual story. | • Runs the calculation scripts or uses the cheatsheet to generate the **Regeneration Flower**.<br>• Prepares the visual for the Week 3 council meeting (digital or physical).<br>• Helps create simple, clear charts for sharing insights. | 2-3 hours |
| **Communications Link** | To ensure clear, warm, and timely information flows to all community members. | • Sends reminders for poll completion and meeting times.<br>• Posts updates in shared community channels.<br>• Manages the shared document or data repository. | 1-2 hours |
| **General Member** | To participate with presence, honesty, and care—the most essential role. | • Completes the qualitative poll thoughtfully.<br>• Attends the Ritual of Diagnosis.<br>• Engages in the selected protocol experiment. | 1-2 hours (poll + meeting) |

## Role Selection & Transition Process

**At the Closing of a Cycle (Week 4):**
1.  The Dashboard Coordinator opens a brief reflection on the roles: "What did it feel like to hold this responsibility? What did you learn?"
2.  An **open invitation** is made for the next cycle's roles. A simple sign-up sheet is circulated.
3.  The outgoing stewolds briefly mentor the incoming stewolds during the transition.

**Key Principle:** No one should hold the same core role (especially Coordinator) for more than two consecutive cycles. This prevents centralization of knowledge and power.

## Collaboration & Support

*   The **Dashboard Coordinator** is the primary point of synthesis, but not a boss. They convene a short (~20 min) check-in with all stewards in **Week 1** and **Week 2**.
*   The **Visual Steward** and **Communications Link** work closely to ensure the right information is shared in the right format.
*   All stewards are encouraged to ask for help from the broader community if their task feels overwhelming.
