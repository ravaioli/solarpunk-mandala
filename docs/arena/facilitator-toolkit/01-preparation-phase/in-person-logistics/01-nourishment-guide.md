# Nourishment Guide: Fueling Collaborative Imagination

## The Solarpunk Table

In a solarpunk future, how we meet is as important as why we meet. Our gatherings must be regenerative, not extractive—and this begins with how we fuel ourselves. The right nourishment acts as a quiet facilitator: stabilizing energy, supporting focus, and embodying the ethics of care and ecological reciprocity we wish to build.

This guide provides practical, low-waste, and energy-sustaining food strategies for in-person sessions. **Feeding people well is a foundational act of facilitation.**

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Sustained Energy:** Prioritize complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, fiber, and protein to avoid energy spikes and crashes.
2.  **Inclusive & Safe:** Proactively account for common dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, nut allergies). Always label food clearly.
3.  **Low-Waste & Local:** Minimize single-use packaging. Choose bulk items and reusable servingware. Source locally when possible.
4.  **Mindful & Unobtrusive:** Food should be easy to eat, quiet, and not disrupt the flow of conversation or deep work.
5.  **Participatory & Joyful:** Whenever possible, make the sharing of food a collaborative, connective ritual.

## The "Focus-Friendly" Food Palette

Think: **Low-glycemic, high-nutrient, and easy to share.**

### 🥨 Sustaining Foundations (Complex Carbs & Protein)
*   **Whole Grains:** Sourdough bread, rye crackers, oatcakes, quinoa salads.
*   **Legumes:** Roasted chickpeas, edamame, hummus, lentil spreads.
*   **Proteins:** Hard-boiled eggs, frittata bites, marinated tofu cubes, a simple cheese board (with vegan alternatives).

### 🥑 Long-Burn Energy (Healthy Fats)
*   **Dips & Spreads:** Baba ganoush, white bean dip, avocado.
*   **Nuts & Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds. *Always provide a separate, clearly marked nut-free zone.*
*   **Oils & Dressings:** Use quality olive oil in dressings for salads and grains.

### 🥦 The Clean Crunch (Hydration & Vitamins)
*   **Vegetable Sticks:** Carrot, cucumber, bell pepper, radish.
*   **Whole Fruits:** Apples, pears, bananas, clementines (nature's perfect packaging).
*   **Berries or Grapes:** Easy to share, no prep required.

### 🍵 The Sip (Hydration & Calm Focus)
*   **Hydration Station:** Infused water (cucumber-mint, lemon-ginger), still and sparkling water.
*   **Caffeine Management:** Good quality coffee and a selection of teas (black, green, herbal). Offer decaf options for afternoon sessions.
*   **Herbal Support:** Mint, chamomile, tulsi (holy basil) – these can support calm concentration.

### ⚠️ What to Limit
*   **Heavy, greasy foods** (cause lethargy).
*   **Purely sugary treats** (lead to energy crashes).
*   **Excessively noisy or strong-smelling foods** (can be distracting).

## Practical Layouts for Session Lengths

### Half-Day Workshop (3-4 hours)
*   **Arrival:** Coffee/tea, water, a simple fruit bowl.
*   **Mid-point Break:** A "nourishment station" with veggie sticks, hummus, whole-grain crackers, and a bowl of mixed nuts/seeds.

### Full-Day Workshop (6-8 hours)
*   **Arrival:** As above.
*   **Morning Break:** Fruit, nuts, perhaps savory muffins.
*   **Lunch:** **The keystone.** Opt for a build-your-own bowl bar:
    *   Bases: Quinoa, brown rice, mixed greens.
    *   Proteins: Lentils, chickpeas, grilled tofu or tempeh.
    *   Veggies: Both roasted and raw options.
    *   Toppings: Seeds, dressings, herbs.
    *   This is inclusive, energy-sustaining, and reduces waste.
*   **Afternoon Break:** "Revival station" with herbal teas, sliced apples with seed butter, and a small offering of dark chocolate (>70%).

### Multi-Day Gathering
*   Rotate and vary options to avoid monotony.
*   Incorporate a **participatory potluck meal** to build community and share culinary culture.
*   For evening socials, consider homemade popcorn with nutritional yeast or a simple, local dessert.

## Facilitator's Checklist: From Plan to Cleanup

*   [ ] **Budget & Source:** Allocate funds. Partner with local bakeries, farms, or co-ops. Buying in bulk reduces cost and waste.
*   [ ] **Communicate:** In pre-session info, ask for dietary restrictions. Plan your menu accordingly.
*   [ ] **Setup & Flow:** Place food in a separate area from the main discussion space to encourage mental breaks.
*   [ ] **The "Hunger Check-in":** As a facilitator, explicitly name breaks as "a time to nourish yourselves." Watch for energy lags—an unscheduled 10-minute snack break can be a powerful tool.
*   [ ] **Cleanup as Care:** Build cleanup into the agenda. Have clearly labeled compost, recycling, and trash bins. Cleaning together is a communal, grounding task.

## A Simple Shopping List Template
*   [ ] Fresh vegetables for slicing (carrots, cucumbers, peppers)
*   [ ] Fresh fruits (apples, bananas, berries)
*   [ ] Dips (hummus, bean dip)
*   [ ] Whole-grain crackers/bread
*   [ ] Nuts/seeds (allergy-aware!)
*   [ ] Coffee, tea (caffeinated & herbal), sweeteners
*   [ ] Milk alternatives (oat, almond)
*   [ ] Large water jugs and infusion ingredients
*   [ ] Serving platters, utensils, napkins (reusable or compostable)

## Conclusion: The First Ritual of Care

In the Solarpunk Mandala, we are practicing the future at every turn. By mindfully feeding our gatherings, we fuel not just bodies, but the deep, patient, and collaborative work of imagination and creation. It is the first and most tangible ritual of mutual care.
