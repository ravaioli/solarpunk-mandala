# Onboarding Guide: Beginning the Dashboard Practice

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide is designed to help you, as a facilitator or community initiator, introduce the Regenerative Capital Dashboard to your community. A successful launch is not about convincing people to use a new tool, but about inviting them into a new practice—one of collective reflection, learning, and intentional growth.

The goal is to build shared understanding, consent, and excitement, transforming the dashboard from an abstract concept into a shared community project.

## Core Narrative: Framing the "Why"

Before explaining the "how," co-create the "why." Adapt these core messages to your community's language and values.

### For the Pragmatists & Planners:

"We measure what we care about. Our current economic and social systems only measure money and growth (GDP). This dashboard is our community's way to start measuring what truly matters to us: the health of our land, the strength of our relationships, our shared well-being, and our sense of purpose. It’s a practical tool to see if we’re actually moving toward the future we say we want."

### For the Heart-Centered & Relational:

"This is an experiment in deeper listening. It's a structured way to hear not just each other's opinions, but the health of the systems we live within. The monthly poll is an invitation to share our lived experience, and the 'Ritual of Diagnosis' is a space to make sense of it together with compassion. It’s about tending to the whole."

### For the Activists & Systems-Thinkers:

"This is a prototype for a new operating system. It’s a cybernetic tool that gives us feedback on our own community as a complex system. It helps us identify the root 'patterns' (cubes) that hold disconnection in place, so we can design interventions that actually shift the system, not just the symptoms."

## Creating the Physical Container

A solarpunk practice requires a solarpunk container. How we meet—the space we create and the nourishment we share—is a direct embodiment of the regenerative future we are building. Thoughtful logistics are not an afterthought; they are a prerequisite for focused, creative, and caring collaboration.

For detailed guidance on this essential aspect of hosting, please refer to the dedicated guides in the **[In-Person Logistics](./in-person-logistics/00-overview.md)** section. Key principles to consider from the start:
*   **Nourishment as Facilitation:** The food and drink you offer can stabilize energy and support sustained focus. See the **[Nourishment Guide](./in-person-logistics/01-nourishment-guide.md)** for principles and practical plans.
*   **The Space as a Collaborator:** The venue's setup, aesthetics, and flow actively support or hinder your group's work. Use the **[Venue & Setup Checklist](./in-person-logistics/02-venue-checklist.md)** to prepare a space that is accessible, inspiring, and functional.

## Suggested Onboarding Pathway

A phased approach helps integrate the practice without overwhelming the community.

### Phase 1: Seed the Idea (1-2 Informal Conversations)

*   **Who:** Start with 2-3 trusted, respected community members who bridge different social groups.
*   **Goal:** Share the core vision and get initial feedback. Use the narratives above.
*   **Ask:** "Does this resonate with a need you feel in our community? What questions or concerns come up for you?"

### Phase 2: The Invitational Launch Meeting

This is the formal start. Frame it as an exploratory conversation, not a rollout. **This is your first opportunity to model the solarpunk logistics outlined above.**

**Sample Agenda (90 minutes):**

*   **Opening Circle (10 min):** Personal check-in: "What is one thing you love about our community that you want to nurture?"
*   **The Big Picture (20 min):** Briefly present the "why" using the narratives. Show the Regeneration Flower graphic from the overview. Emphasize: "This is a learning tool for us, by us. We will define our own success."
*   **Interactive Exploration (40 min):**
    *   Break into small groups. Give each group one of the Five Domains (Politics, Economics, Culture, Ecology, Spirituality).
    *   Ask: "If we were to measure the health of our community in this area, what 1-2 simple things would we look at or ask about?" (e.g., For Ecology: "Are we planting more trees than we cut down?" "Do we know our local bird species?").
    *   Groups report back. This activity immediately makes the framework their own.
*   **Q&A & Discuss Next Steps (15 min):**
    *   Address concerns transparently. Common ones: "Is this extra work?" (Frame it as streamlining our existing care into visible form). "Will this be used to judge people?" (Emphasize it measures systemic health, not individual performance).
    *   Propose a Pilot: "Let's run one 4-week cycle as a full-community experiment. Then we decide if it's useful to continue."
*   **Closing Circle (5 min):** "In one word, what's your feeling about trying this experiment?"

### Phase 3: Form the Initial Stewardship Circle

After the launch meeting, invite volunteers to form a light-touch "Pod" to guide the first cycle. Key roles (from `role-descriptions.md`):

*   **Dashboard Coordinator:** Keeps the process moving, primary facilitator.
*   **Domain Stewards (1-2 people per domain):** Responsible for gathering that domain's quantitative data.
*   **Visual Steward:** Helps prepare the Flower visualization for meetings.
*   **Communications Link:** Ensures everyone knows what's happening when.

**Important:** Frame these as short-term, experimental commitments for one cycle only. This lowers the barrier to participation.

## First Practical Steps: Scoping Your Pilot

Use the `scoping-worksheet.md` in detail, but start with these three questions in your Stewardship Circle:

*   **Temporal Scope:** Which 4-week period will be our first sprint? Mark the dates.
*   **Community Scope:** Are we including everyone, or a specific neighborhood, working group, or project team for the pilot? Define the "we."
*   **Focus Scope:** For our first cycle, should we a) try to measure all five domains lightly, or b) dive deep on the one domain that feels most urgent/interesting to us? (Recommendation: Start with Option A for a complete, if initial, picture).
*   **Logistical Scope:** Review the **[In-Person Logistics](./in-person-logistics/00-overview.md)** guides. Who will handle venue booking, setup, and nourishment for the upcoming Sprint Cycle meetings? Integrate these tasks into your stewardship roles.

## What Success Looks Like in the First Cycle

Set realistic, learning-oriented goals for your pilot:

*   ✅ We held the four meetings (or touchpoints) of the sprint cycle in a thoughtfully prepared space.
*   ✅ We gathered some data and stories for each domain.
*   ✅ We generated our first Regeneration Flower and Alpha score.
*   ✅ We had one meaningful conversation about what the data reflected.
*   ✅ We decided, as a group, whether to continue, pause, or adapt the practice.

The goal is learning and building the habit, not achieving a high Alpha score.

## Troubleshooting Early Resistance

*   **"This feels too abstract."** Respond with: "Let's ground it. What's one concrete project or issue in our community we care about? Let's see how looking at it through these five domains changes our perspective."
*   **"We don't have time for this."** Respond with: "The time is already being spent on meetings, misunderstandings, or projects that don't align. This is an investment to make our existing time more focused and fruitful. The first cycle is a short experiment to test that."
*   **"Who are you to measure this?"** Respond with: "No one is 'measuring' anyone. We are all sensing the system we co-create. The dashboard is just a mirror we're holding up together. You are essential in deciding what we look for in that mirror."
*   **"Logistics are too complicated."** Respond with: "We've created simple, principled checklists to make this easy. Let's look at the **[Nourishment](./in-person-logistics/01-nourishment-guide.md)** and **[Venue](./in-person-logistics/02-venue-checklist.md)** guides together and divide the tasks."

## Your Immediate Next Steps

1.  Read the `role-descriptions.md` to understand the team structure.
2.  Complete the `scoping-worksheet.md` with your initial stewards.
3.  **Review the [In-Person Logistics](./in-person-logistics/00-overview.md) overview and its two core guides with your team.**
4.  Schedule your Launch Meeting and craft your invitation using the narrative above.
5.  Proceed to the resources for `Week 1: Gather` once your pilot is scoped and your team is ready.

Remember: You are planting a seed. Your job is to provide good soil (clear intention), water (compassionate process), sunlight (transparent communication), and a nourishing physical container. The community provides the growth.
