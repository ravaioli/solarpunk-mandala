## [Community Name] - Dashboard Cycle #[Number] Brief
**Date of Brief:** [Date]
**Prepared for:** Ritual of Diagnosis on [Meeting Date]
**Prepared by:** [Name of Coordinator/Steward]

### 1. The Regeneration Flower & Alpha Coefficient
*Attach or embed the visual here.*

- **Alpha (α) Coefficient:** **[Value, e.g., 0.61]**
- **Interpretive Phase:** **[Proto-System / Differentiating System / Integrated System]**
- **Overall Narrative:** In one sentence, describe the overall state.
  *"Our system shows **[describe, e.g., moderate, balanced vitality with one clear area of contraction]**."*

### 2. Domain Highlights & Lowlights
*A quick scan of strengths and growth edges.*

| Domain | Score (1-10) | Brief Note / Key Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🌿 Ecology** | [Score] | **[e.g., Our strongest domain. Stewardship is high, but biophilic connection is lower than expected.]** |
| **🔄 Economics** | [Score] | **[e.g., Solid production, but very low convivial score indicates time poverty.]** |
| **👥 Politics** | [Score] | **[e.g., Relational trust is high, but civic participation in maintenance is dropping.]** |
| **🎨 Culture** | [Score] | **[e.g., Aesthetic capital is growing! Narrative capital took a slight dip this cycle.]** |
| **☀️ Spirituality** | [Score] | **[e.g., Our most challenged domain. Purpose and interbeing scores are consistently low.]** |

### 3. Top Qualitative Themes from the Poll
*What did the stories say? List 3-5 verbatim, anonymized themes.*

1.  **[e.g., "A shared feeling of being constantly behind on tasks."]**
2.  **[e.g., "Many expressed deep joy and connection during the weekly communal meal."]**
3.  **[e.g., "Several people mentioned not knowing how to contribute outside their formal role."]**

### 4. Key Data Points & Surprises
*Any notable facts from the quantitative data?*

-   **[e.g., Soil health improved to 5.2% organic matter, hitting our target.]**
-   **[e.g., Time bank exchanges dropped by 30% this cycle.]**
-   **[e.g., 95% attendance at the last seasonal festival.]**

### 5. Suggested Focus for Diagnosis
*Based on the data, where might our inquiry be most fruitful? This is not a pre-diagnosis, but a suggested starting point.*

**Primary Pattern to Explore:** The data suggests we should pay particular attention to the tension between **[e.g., high Productive Capital] and [e.g., low Convivial Capital]**, and the recurring narrative theme of **[e.g., "time scarcity"]**. This often points toward the **Productivity Cube**.

**Question to Hold:** *"Is our sense of worth tied to output, and is this creating a systemic contraction in our well-being and freedom?"*

## How to Use This Brief

1.  **Send this document** to council members 24 hours before the meeting (if possible).
2.  **At the meeting's start,** briefly walk through sections 1, 2, and 3 to ensure everyone is looking at the same picture.
3.  **Use section 5** as a potential entry point for the diagnostic dialogue, but hold it lightly—the council's lived experience may point elsewhere.

**Remember:** This brief provides the *what*. The Ritual of Diagnosis is about discovering the *why* and the *what next*.
