# Protocol Selection Worksheet

## Purpose of This Worksheet

This worksheet guides the council from the **diagnosed "cube"** to selecting a specific **protocol**—a practice, ritual, or intervention—to experiment with in the next cycle. Its purpose is to make the choice deliberate, contextual, and aligned with the community's capacity and curiosity.

**Time Needed:** 20-30 minutes during the Week 4 council meeting.
**Materials:** Diagnosed cube from Week 3, this worksheet, knowledge of community capacity.

## Part 1: Re-Anchoring in the Diagnosis

**Our Diagnosed Cube:** *[Write the cube name from Week 3 here, e.g., Productivity Cube]*

**Core Contraction:** *[Briefly describe the pattern in your own words, e.g., "Worth tied to output, leading to time poverty and burnout."]*

**Reminder:** A protocol is not a "solution" to "fix" us. It is a **conscious intervention in a system**—an experiment to see what happens when we intentionally soften a rigid pattern.

## Part 2: Brainstorming Potential Protocols

Based on your diagnosed cube, brainstorm protocols that directly address its core contraction. Use the Mandala's appendices, your community's existing wisdom, or the suggestions below as sparks.

### For the **Productivity Cube** (Worth = Output)
*Potential Protocols:*
- **Right Livelihood Audit:** A guided process for members to reflect on how their work aligns with personal purpose and community need.
- **Mandatory Minimum Leisure:** Instituting a community-wide rule (e.g., "No work talk after 6 PM" or "Everyone takes a 3-hour 'useless afternoon' each week").
- **Output-Free Gathering:** Hosting a regular meetup where sharing about projects or tasks is explicitly forbidden; connection is the only goal.

### For the **Transaction Cube** (Relationships = Exchange)
*Potential Protocols:*
- **Blind Gift Circle:** A ritual where members give offers of help or gifts without specifying a recipient or expecting anything in return.
- **Conflict as Compost Workshop:** Training in non-violent communication or restorative circles to transform conflict from a transaction gone wrong into fertile ground for growth.
- **Skill-Share Without Barter:** A library-style system where skills are offered freely as a commons, decoupled from direct exchange.

### For the **Separation Cube** (Disconnection)
*Potential Protocols:*
- **More-Than-Human Council:** A regular ritual where the community contemplates decisions from the perspective of local plants, animals, or ecosystems.
- **Biophilic Design Sprint:** A focused project to physically reshape a communal space to increase connection with nature (e.g., building a bird blind, a sensory garden).
- **Shared Vulnerability Practice:** A structured check-in where members share something personally vulnerable, rebuilding bonds of trust.

### For the **Control Cube** (Order from Above)
*Potential Protocols:*
- **Consent-Based Decision Trial:** Using consent ("no paramount objections") instead of consensus for a set of small decisions.
- **Distributed Stewardship Day:** A day where formal roles and hierarchies are dissolved, and everyone is invited to step into any needed task.
- **Emergent Strategy Game:** A workshop using play to practice adapting to changing conditions without a central plan.

**Our Brainstormed List:** *[List 3-5 protocol ideas that feel resonant.]*

## Part 3: Selection Criteria

Discuss each brainstormed idea using these filters. The goal is to find the **easiest, safest, and most instructive** experiment.

| Criteria | Question to Ask | Notes/Score (Low/Med/High) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alignment** | Does it directly address the core of our diagnosed cube? | |
| **Load** | Is it light-touch? Does it *reduce* burden rather than add new work? | |
| **Learnability** | Will it give us clear feedback? How will we know what effect it's having? | |
| **Joy & Beauty** | Does it feel enlivening, playful, or beautiful to engage with? | |
| **Safety** | Does it feel psychologically and physically safe to try? | |

## Part 4: Making the Choice

**Our Selected Protocol for the Next Cycle is:** *[Write the chosen protocol name here]*

**Primary Reason for Choosing It:** *[e.g., "It's the lightest-touch intervention that still gets at the root of our Productivity Cube."]*

**Next Step:** Use the **Experiment Canvas** to design the details of how we will run this protocol.
