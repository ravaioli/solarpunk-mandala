# Facilitator Questions Bank

## Purpose & How to Use

This is a bank of questions to help you facilitate dialogue during the Ritual of Diagnosis. Choose questions that fit the energy and depth of the moment. Your primary tools are **curiosity** and **silence**—ask a question, then let the space hold the answers.

## Questions for Phase 2: Observation & Sensing

**To open observation of the Regeneration Flower:**
*   "What do you notice first when you look at this shape?"
*   "If this Flower were a landscape, what would it feel like to walk through it?"
*   "Where does the shape feel full or abundant? Where does it feel pinched or fragile?"

**To connect data to lived experience:**
*   "Which part of this data resonates most deeply with your own experience this past month?"
*   "What here surprises you? What confirms what you already sensed?"
*   "If this Flower could speak, what one word might it say?"

**To move from observation to feeling:**
*   "Where in your body do you feel a response to seeing this picture of our community?"
*   "What emotion arises when you see the gap between our strongest and weakest domain?"

## Questions for Phase 3: Diagnosis & Naming the Cube

**To explore the impact of patterns:**
*   "How might the **[Lowest Scoring Domain, e.g., Convivial Capital]** be connected to the **[Highest Scoring Domain, e.g., Productive Capital]**? What story does that relationship tell?"
*   "If the narrative theme of **'[e.g., constant busyness]'** were to grow a root, what cube might it be feeding?"
*   "What do we lose, as a community, by operating inside this potential cube?"

**To test a cube hypothesis:**
*   "If the **Productivity Cube** is present, where would we see its fingerprints in our daily routines or unspoken rules?"
*   "What small evidence from the past month points toward the **Transaction Cube**?"
*   "How might dissolving the **Separation Cube** begin to change the shape of our Flower?"

**To reach convergence:**
*   "What feels most at the *root*, rather than just a symptom?"
*   "Which cube, if we worked on it, would likely make the others easier to address?"
*   "Is there a cube we are *afraid* to name? What makes it scary?"

## Questions for Managing Stuckness or Conflict

**If debate becomes circular:**
*   "Let's pause. What is the underlying need or value each side of this debate is trying to protect?"
*   "What if both observations are true? What larger pattern might contain them both?"

**If energy is low or disengaged:**
*   "Let's check in. What's missing from this conversation for it to feel meaningful?"
*   "Should we take a 2-minute stretch break and come back with one fresh intuition?"

**If one perspective dominates:**
*   "Thank you for that. Let's now hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."
*   "I'm curious about the opposite perspective. What might someone who disagreed with that last point be seeing or feeling?"

## The Most Powerful Question (Use Sparingly)

*   **"What is this system *most wanting* to become?"**
    *(This question, asked from a place of deep listening, can bypass analysis and access collective intuition. Use it only after sufficient sensing and trust has been built.)*

## A Note on Your Stance

Your role is not to have the right question, but to be **deeply present**. Listen for what is *not* being said. Trust that the group's wisdom will emerge if you hold a brave and gentle space for it.
