# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Philosophy of Trouble

Difficulty in this process is not a sign you are doing it wrong. It is often a sign you are doing something *real*. The system is responding. Your task is not to eliminate friction but to **understand its message** and adapt with wisdom. Below are common challenges and approaches grounded in the Mandala's principles.

## General Principles for All Challenges

Before seeking specific solutions, ask:
1.  **Is this a technical problem or a human/relational one?**
2.  **What might this difficulty be trying to tell us about our community system?**
3.  **Can we simplify?** Return to the core purpose: collective learning.

## By Phase: Common Challenges & Responses

### Preparation & Onboarding
**Q: People are skeptical or resistant to "another measuring tool."**
- **A:** This is healthy skepticism. Do not convince; *demonstrate*.
    - **Reframe:** "Let's not adopt it. Let's *test* it for one cycle as an experiment. Then we decide if it's useful." Use the language of a "pilot."
    - **Connect to Pain:** "What's one recurring frustration in our community? Let's see if looking at it through these five domains gives us a new perspective."
    - **Emphasize Self-Definition:** "The metrics aren't imposed. We get to define what 'health' means in each area for *us*."

### Week 1: Gather
**Q: We have low participation in the qualitative poll.**
- **A:** Participation is a measure of **Relational Capital**, not a failure of promotion.
    - **Diagnose:** Is it a trust issue? A time issue? A clarity issue? Ask directly in a low-stakes way.
    - **Simplify:** Use the **offline poll sheet** and a physical ballot box. Make it a ritual during a shared meal.
    - **Model & Share:** Have a trusted member share *why* they take the poll and what they get from it. Normalize reflection.
    - **Accept:** 30% participation from an engaged core can still yield valid thematic data. Focus on nurturing the practice.

**Q: The quantitative data is hard to get or doesn't exist.**
- **A:** "We don't measure that" is **valid data**.
    - **Action:** Record a `0` or `N/A` and note it. This shows a gap in your **Knowledge** or **Administrative Capital**.
    - **Experiment:** The very act of trying to find a number may spur the creation of a simple log. That's a positive systemic change.
    - **Pivot:** Use a simple estimate or proxy. The goal is directional awareness, not scientific precision.

### Week 2: Calculate
**Q: The calculations feel confusing or time-consuming.**
- **A:** This is a sign to prioritize **Convivial Capital** in your process.
    - **Simplify Drastically:** Use the **hand-drawn Flower method**. Plot domain scores based on rough steward consensus, not complex math. The conversation about "what score feels right?" is more valuable than a decimal point.
    - **Automate:** If you have technical capacity, use or build the simple **Alpha Calculator script**.
    - **Delegate & Rotate:** Ensure the Visual Steward role is rotated so no one bears the burden long-term.

### Week 3: Diagnose
**Q: The council conversation gets stuck in debate or goes in circles.**
- **A:** You are likely in a **Transaction Cube** (debate as score-keeping) or **Control Cube** (vying for the right answer).
    - **Intervene:** "I notice we're in a debate. Let's pause. What's the deeper need or fear underneath each of these positions?"
    - **Change Modality:** Move from talking to writing. "Take 2 minutes to write your core point, then we'll read them without comment."
    - **Use the Body:** "Let's stand up, shake for 30 seconds, and come back. Now, share one *felt sense* in your body about this issue."
    - **Refer to Cube Cards:** "Does this dynamic feel like one of our cubes playing out *right now in this room*?"

**Q: We can't agree on which "cube" to diagnose.**
- **A:** Forcing consensus on the *name* misses the point. Seek agreement on the *pattern*.
    - **Action:** Describe the pattern without naming it. "So, we seem to be saying the core issue is a feeling that our time is not our own, and that we only value visible work. Does that feel accurate?" If yes, you have a diagnosis—call it "Pattern X" for now. The protocol you choose matters more than the label.

### Week 4: Act
**Q: We pick an experiment but then nobody follows through.**
- **A:** This is often a failure of the **Experiment Canvas**, not of willpower.
    - **Prevention:** Ensure your canvas has a **named steward** and **obvious, tiny first steps**. "Launch" means one person does one specific thing by a specific date.
    - **Response:** At the next check-in, don't blame. **Learn:** "What about the experiment made it hard to start? Was it too big? Unclear? Did life simply swallow it?" Use that to redesign.

### The Alpha Coefficient & Scores
**Q: Our Alpha score dropped (or is low). People feel discouraged.**
- **A:** The dashboard is a mirror, not a report card. A dropping score often means you're **measuring more honestly**, not failing.
    - **Reframe:** "This is excellent data. It means our mirror is getting clearer. We are seeing a truth we couldn't see before. This is the start of real growth."
    - **Focus on Learning:** "What one insight from this lower score can we take? What does it free us to focus on?"
    - **Celebrate the Practice:** "The fact that we are even looking at this together is a sign of immense **Civic** and **Wisdom Capital**. That is a victory."

**Q: We're obsessing over the scores and losing the spirit.**
- **A:** You have encountered the **Productivity Cube** within the dashboard practice itself.
    - **Prescribe a Meta-Protocol:** Your next experiment should be on the dashboard process. E.g., "For one cycle, we will generate the Flower but not calculate Alpha. We will only discuss the stories."
    - **Re-center on Ritual:** Spend more time in the opening silence and the closing appreciation. The numbers are just the catalyst for the human conversation.

## When to Pause or Reset

If the process is causing significant harm, strain, or resentment:
1.  **Call a Pause:** "We are putting the dashboard on hold for [one month/one cycle]."
2.  **Conduct a Retrospective:** Use a simple format: "What worked? What didn't? What should we do differently if we restart?"
3.  **Return to Purpose:** Re-read the **Overview**. Why did we start this? Does that reason still hold?
4.  **Remember:** The Mandala is a servant to your community's flourishing, not its master. You have full permission to adapt, simplify, or stop.

**Final Note:** You are pioneers. There is no perfect way to do this. Your honest struggles and adaptations are the most valuable contribution you can make to this living framework.
