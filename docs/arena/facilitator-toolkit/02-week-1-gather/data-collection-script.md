# Data Collection Script: Framing the "Gather" Phase

## Purpose of This Script

This script provides you with the language and framing to introduce the Week 1 data collection process to your community. Its goal is to transform the task from a bureaucratic chore into a meaningful, collective act of **attending** and **listening**.

## Core Narrative: The Two Kinds of Listening

Begin by explaining that we are gathering two distinct, complementary types of data. Use this metaphor:

*"This week, we are engaging in two kinds of listening. Think of it like checking the health of a forest.*
1.  ***Quantitative Listening (The 'Vitals'):*** *This is like measuring the soil pH, counting the number of new saplings, or tracking the rainfall. It's about **observable facts and figures** that we can count or measure. In our community, these are things like 'hours volunteered' or 'percentage of local food eaten.'*
2.  ***Qualitative Listening (The 'Stories'):*** *This is like sitting quietly in the forest and noticing the feeling in the air, the quality of bird song, or the sense of peace (or disturbance) you feel. It's about **lived experience, feelings, and narratives**. In our community, this is the poll where we share our personal sense of connection, trust, or purpose.*

*Both are essential. The numbers without the stories are hollow. The stories without any numbers can lack grounding. Together, they give us a full picture."*

## Step-by-Step Facilitator Guide

### 1. Introduce the Roles & Process (5-10 mins)
**Say:** *"For the quantitative data, our Domain Stewards (Kai for Ecology, Sam for Culture, etc.) will be gathering a few simple numbers for their area over the next few days. They might reach out to some of you for specific info from projects or logs.*
*For the qualitative stories, **every single one of us** is invited to participate. You'll receive a link to a short, reflective poll. Your anonymous, honest responses are the heart of this process."*

### 2. Launch the Qualitative Poll (The Key Moment)
**This is the most important action. Say:**
*"In a moment, I will share a link to our monthly community pulse check. This is **not a test or evaluation**. It is a chance for your individual voice to be blended into our collective sense of direction. The questions ask for your perception and feelings about different aspects of our life together.*
*Please answer from your heart. There are no right or wrong answers, only true ones. Your anonymity is protected. The results will be shared back as grouped themes, never individual responses."*

**🔹 Facilitator's Note:** *Have the poll link ready to paste into the chat, post on a shared board, or include in the follow-up email. Pause here to share it visibly.*

### 3. Address Common Questions & Concerns
Be ready to respond calmly to these potential concerns:

*   **"This seems like a lot of work."**
    *   *Response: "The stewards have a simple checklist. For the poll, it's about 10 minutes of reflection. We believe this small investment saves time later by helping us focus our energy on what truly matters."*
*   **"Why should I trust this? How will my data be used?"**
    *   *Response: "A core rule is that this data **never** gets used to judge or blame individuals. It is only used to generate our Regeneration Flower and inform our whole-community conversations. It's a tool for systemic learning, not personal performance."*
*   **"What if I don't know the answer to a quantitative question?"**
    *   *Response: "For the stewards: your best, honest estimate is perfect. 'We don't know' or 'We don't measure that yet' is a **valid and important data point**. It tells us where we might want to develop our capacity for attention."*

### 4. Clear Next Steps & Timeline
**State clearly:**
*   *"**Domain Stewards**, please aim to have your numbers to our Visual Steward by **[Date, e.g., Friday].**"*
*   *"**Everyone**, the qualitative poll will remain open until **[Date, e.g., Sunday night].** Please try to find a quiet 10 minutes to complete it."*
*   *"**Our next touchpoint** will be in Week 2, where we'll share back the synthesized Regeneration Flower for us all to see."*

## Closing the Session

End by reconnecting to the purpose.
*"Thank you for engaging in this practice of collective listening. By contributing our numbers and our stories, we are literally weaving the material to see ourselves more clearly. This is how we grow consciously."*
