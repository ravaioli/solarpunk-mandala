# Protocol Worksheets for the Rhizomatic Network

## Introduction
These worksheets provide practical tools for implementing the four core protocols of the Arena. Each worksheet includes assessment questions, scoring guidance, and implementation templates. They are designed to be used sequentially, with Protocol 0 as the essential foundation.

## Protocol 0: Embodied Foundations Assessment Worksheet

### Purpose
Ensure basic human needs are met before higher-order transformation can occur.

### Assessment Questions (Score 1-5 for each)

#### Nourishment Domain
1. Do community members have reliable access to nutritious food and clean water? (1=Never, 5=Always)
2. Are communal eating spaces available and welcoming to all? (1=No spaces, 5=Multiple inclusive spaces)
3. Do food systems connect people to seasonal cycles and local ecology? (1=Completely disconnected, 5=Deeply connected)

#### Cleansing Domain
1. Do all community members have access to clean water for bathing and hygiene? (1=No access, 5=Universal access)
2. Are waste systems designed to transform rather than dispose? (1=Landfill only, 5=Full circular metabolism)
3. Are emotional cleansing practices (grief circles, conflict resolution) regularly available? (1=Never available, 5=Regularly practiced)

#### Restoration Domain
1. Do community members have access to adequate sleep and rest spaces? (1=No safe rest spaces, 5=Multiple dedicated rest spaces)
2. Are trauma healing resources accessible to those who need them? (1=No resources, 5=Multiple modalities available)
3. Are daily and seasonal rest rhythms honored in community rhythms? (1=Constant activity, 5=Respected rhythm cycles)

#### Movement Domain
1. Can all community members move safely through community spaces? (1=High danger, 5=Universal safety)
2. Are there regular opportunities for communal movement (dance, walking, labor)? (1=No opportunities, 5=Multiple regular opportunities)
3. Do decision-making systems allow for movement of power and resources? (1=Power hoarded, 5=Power circulated)

### Dissociation Lens Assessment
For each foundation domain:
1. Which dissociation boundary does this foundation heal? (Cube 5: body-MAL boundary)
2. How does stabilizing this foundation help us remember belonging to Mind at Large?
3. What boundary medicine practices support this foundation? (e.g., communal eating for Nourishment)

### Dialectical Velocity Check
Current community movement between phases: _____ (0-1.0 scale)  
If velocity <0.2, focus only on most critical foundation rather than all four.

### Scoring Rubric
- **1-1.9**: Emergency level - immediate intervention required
- **2-2.9**: Foundational level - can proceed with basic protocols
- **3-3.9**: Stable level - ready for intermediate work
- **4-5**: Regenerative level - ready for advanced transformation

### Boundary Rule
If any foundation scores below 2, pause all other protocols and activate Protocol 3 with foundation focus until:
- Scores reach at least 2.0, AND
- Dialectical velocity metric reaches at least 0.2, AND
- Community can articulate how foundation work connects to MAL belonging

4. Rate 1-5: The degree to which time is held as sacred rather than extracted

### Cross-Walk Integration Matrix
[Create 5x5 grid with Ekistics Elements on vertical axis, Circles Domains on horizontal axis]  
For each interface, score 1-5 on:
1. **Connectivity** (are these domains connected in community practice?)
2. **Vitality** (is this connection alive and regenerative?)
3. **Blockage** (what prevents this connection from flourishing?)

### 24 Faces Priority Identification
Circle the 3 lowest-scoring interfaces. These are your primary intervention points.

## Protocol 2: Project Design Integration Worksheet

### Purpose
Ensure holistic project design that integrates space, function, and purpose.

### Dual-Framework Briefing Template
**Project Name:** ________________________  
**Conception Question (Awakening):** What evokes wonder about this project?  
**Design Principles (Making):**  
1. What will this project produce or transform? ________________________  
2. How will biological needs be met through this project? ________________________  
3. How will waste be transformed into resource? ________________________  
**Implementation Plan (Liberation):**  
1. How will decisions be made? ________________________  
2. Who has power and how will it be shared? ________________________  
3. How will accountability be maintained? ________________________  
**Evaluation Metrics (Healing):**  
1. How will past harms be addressed? ________________________  
2. How will learning be captured and shared? ________________________  
3. How will relationships be repaired if damage occurs? ________________________  

### Stakeholder Mapping Exercise
Draw concentric circles with project at center:
1. **Inner Circle**: Direct participants (Who is doing the work?)
2. **Middle Circle**: Affected parties (Who is impacted by this work?)
3. **Outer Circle**: Broader community (Who should know about this work?)

For each circle, identify:
1. What they give to the project
2. What they receive from the project
3. How they will be included in decision-making

### Hexagonal Intervention Planning
[Draw hexagram with project at center, 6 surrounding points for implementation areas]

**Six Implementation Points:**
1. **Nourishment Node**: How will this project feed people (physically, emotionally, culturally)?
2. **Cleansing Node**: How will this project transform waste and toxicity?
3. **Restoration Node**: How will this project heal damage and build resilience?
4. **Movement Node**: How will this project enable flow and circulation?
5. **Connection Node**: How will this project strengthen relationships?
6. **Vision Node**: How will this project honor time and future generations?

### Embodied Threshold Check
Before finalizing design, verify:
1. Nourishment foundation ≥ 2 for all participants
2. Cleansing foundation ≥ 2 for all participants  
3. Restoration foundation ≥ 2 for all participants
4. Movement foundation ≥ 2 for all participants

If any foundation scores below 2, redesign project to strengthen foundations first.

## Facilitator Guidance Notes

### Protocol Sequencing
1. Always begin with Protocol 0 - no other protocol can succeed without foundation stability
2. Move to Protocol 1 when all foundations score ≥2
3. Activate Protocol 2 during stable periods for planned initiatives
4. Shift to Protocol 3 when foundations drop below 2 or external crisis hits
5. Return to Protocol 1 when crisis stabilizes to reassess

### Scoring Consistency Tips
1. Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
2. Score based on the most vulnerable community members, not the most privileged
3. Reassess every 3 months minimum, or after any significant event
4. Have multiple people score independently, then discuss differences

### Red Flags That Indicate Bypassing
1. Community members reporting burnout while foundations remain weak
2. Projects focused on "higher purpose" while basic needs go unmet
3. Spiritual language used to avoid addressing material conditions
4. Decision-making dominated by those with strongest personal foundations
5. Metrics that look good while community members struggle

### Integration with SolarPunk Compass
After completing these protocols, use the Compass to:
1. Identify which Pathway (Awakening, Making, Liberation, Healing) is most needed based on assessment
2. Map which Ekistics Element requires attention based on hexagonal analysis
3. Set one small, concrete
