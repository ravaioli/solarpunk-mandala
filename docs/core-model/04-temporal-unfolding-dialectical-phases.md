# Temporal Unfolding: From -1D to 4D

All four axes unfold across the same dimensional spectrum, mapping the journey from dissociation to reintegration. The embodied foundations layer provides the necessary stability for dimensional unfolding:

## Unified Phase Mapping Table
| Dimension | Ontological Stage | Dialectical Phase | Primary Focus | MAL Integration | Embodied Foundations Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| -1D | Unmanifest Potential | Pre-manifest | Pure potential | Pure potential in MAL | N/A (pre-dissociation state) |
| 0D | Point Identity | Dissolution | Nourishment | Boundary recognition | Survival mode (Nourishment priority) |
| 1D | Linear Narrative | Emergence | Cleansing | Reciprocal metabolism | Stability building (Cleansing priority) |
| 2D | Relational Plane | Integration | Movement | Internalized responsibility | Connection building (Movement priority) |
| 3D | Volumetric Self | Transformation | Restoration | Deep time awareness | Reciprocal systems (Restoration priority) |
| 4D | Tesseractive Wholeness | Reunification | All foundations | Participatory consciousness | Symbiotic belonging (all foundations integrated) |

## Integration Notes
- **Communities cannot sustain 3D wholeness without 0D security and 2D connection without stable 1D foundations.** The Embodied Foundations are not "lower" in value but foundational in function—like roots to a tree.
- **At the 2D scale**, research on neural entropy (Froese) shows how individual 'irruptions' synchronize during collective rituals, creating measurable group coherence that facilitates adaptive social behavior.

## Dialectical Velocity Metric
Communities can rate their movement between phases on a 0-1.0 scale (0=stagnant, 0.5=transitioning, 1.0=flowing). No pathway can activate when velocity <0.2 or any foundation scores <2.0.

## Hive Development Model
The dialectical phases mirror honeybee colony development:
- **0D Dissolution** = Colony overcrowding; swarm preparation begins
- **1D Emergence** = Swarm clusters temporarily; scout bees search
- **2D Integration** = New nest site chosen; bees begin comb construction
- **3D Transformation** = Fully functional hive transforming local ecology
- **4D Reunification** = Genetic continuity despite physical separation; hive networks
