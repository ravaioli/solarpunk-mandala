# Ethical Dimensions: The Four Axes of Transformation

The Tesseract orients not just knowing, but becoming. Transformation unfolds along four orthogonal ethical axes, each measurable through the Rhizomatic Network:

| Axis | Question | Rhizomatic Anchor | Embodied Foundation Dependency | Contraction Signal |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Soteriological | How integrated is the self? | SPIRITUALITY + MAN | Requires Restoration ≥ 2 to sustain inner work | Fragmented narrative, rigid identity |
| 2. Axiological | How regenerative is the system? | ECONOMICS + ECOLOGY + SHELLS | Requires Nourishment ≥ 2 to build regenerative systems | Ecological overshoot, extractive logic |
| 3. Relational Depth | How connected are we? | CULTURE + SOCIETY | Requires Movement ≥ 2 to sustain relational flow | Transactional relationships, polarization |
| 4. Temporal Orientation | How wisely do we hold time? | CULTURE: Memory & Projection + NATURE: Climate | Requires Cleansing ≥ 2 to clear temporal blockages | Short-termism, historical amnesia |

## Core Threshold Principle
No pathway or protocol can be fully activated when any foundation scores below 2 on a 1-5 scale. Systems attempting higher-dimensional work without stable foundations collapse into bypassing.

## Threshold Decision Tree (applies to all protocols)
- If any foundation <2 → Activate Protocol 3 with foundation focus
- If all foundations ≥2 but α <2 → Activate Protocol 1 for diagnosis
- If all foundations ≥3 and α ≥2 → Activate Protocol 2 for design
- If all foundations ≥4 and α ≥3 → Engage 4D reunification practices

## Foundation-Specific Thresholds by Pathway
| Pathway | Primary Foundation Dependency | Activation Threshold | Contraction Signal |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Awakening (Conscientização) | Restoration | Restoration ≥2 | Fragmented narrative, rigid identity |
| Making (Capacitação) | Nourishment | Nourishment ≥2 | Ecological overshoot, extractive logic |
| Liberation (Liberação) | Movement | Movement ≥2 | Transactional relationships, polarization |
| Healing (Cura) | Cleansing | Cleansing ≥2 | Short-termism, historical amnesia |

## Boundary Medicine Note
When thresholds are not met, the response is not to force higher-dimensional work but to apply appropriate boundary medicine to heal the dissociation blocking foundation stability.
