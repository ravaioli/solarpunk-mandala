# Compatible Frameworks Matrix

The Solarpunk Mandala is not a closed system but an **integrative architecture**. Its value lies in providing a coherent, consciousness-first ontology and geometry—the Tesseract—that can meaningfully relate and translate between other powerful frameworks. This matrix maps established models from systems science, social theory, and design to the Mandala's core components, demonstrating how they can be **contextualized, enhanced, and made mutually intelligible** without losing their unique insights.

This integration follows a core principle: **The Mandala provides the "why" (ontology) and the "shape" (epistemic geometry); compatible frameworks provide specialized "hows" (methodologies)** for navigating specific challenges within that larger field.

## 1. Frameworks Aligned with Tesseract Geometry

These frameworks share the Mandala's fundamental understanding of reality as relational, complex, and multi-dimensional.

| Framework | Compatibility Points | Integration Protocol | Dialectical Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Donella Meadows' Systems Thinking** | Shares understanding of leverage points in complex systems. The 12 leverage points map to different levels of systemic depth, analogous to moving through the Mandala's dimensions. | Use Meadows' 12 leverage points as a diagnostic lens during **Protocol 1 (Diagnostic Weaving)**. A focus on "paradigms" (point 2) relates to the **Soteriological Axis**; "system goals" (point 4) to the **Axiological Axis**. | Aligns with the concept of **Folded Cubes** as boundary dimensions that can be "leveraged." Changing a system's rules (Meadows' point 6) is a 2D/Relational Plane intervention. |
| **Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM)** | Its recursive cybernetic structure—where every viable system contains and is contained by other viable systems—mirrors the Mandala's principle of **dimensional scaling** (self-similarity across scales). | Map VSM's 5 subsystems to the Mandala's architecture: System 1 (Operations) = **Embodied Foundations**; Systems 2-3 (Coordination/Control) = **Grid Completion** logic; System 4 (Intelligence) = **Pathways**; System 5 (Policy) = **Ethical Axes**. | VSM's recursive viability directly aligns with the **Nested Activation** principle of Geometric Completion. A failure in System 1 (Foundations) collapses higher functions. |
| **Nora Bateson's Symmathesy** | Rejects fragmented, reductionist metrics in favor of contextual, mutualistic learning. This aligns perfectly with the Mandala's **relational ontology** and the **Multiple Intelligences Framework**. | Apply symmathesy principles to the design of **boundary permeability** and community learning rituals. It transforms data collection from extraction to a relational act, enriching the **Rhizomatic Network**. | Honors **Seasonal Cycles and Breath Rhythm** patterns, insisting that understanding emerges from within a living context, not from abstracted measurement. |

## 2. Frameworks Aligned with Four Pathways

These frameworks offer concrete methodologies that can be "plugged into" the Mandala's four primary pathways of action.

| Pathway | Compatible Framework | Integration Protocol | Embodied Foundation Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Awakening** | **Paulo Freire's Critical Pedagogy** | The core methodology for the Path of Awakening. Use Freirean problem-posing education and "conscientização" in circle practices to reveal social and internalized oppression. | Enhances **Movement** by creating the social and emotional flow necessary to question entrenched narratives, aligning action with seasonal cycles of reflection and action. |
| **Making** | **Neri Oxman's Material Ecology** | Apply Material Ecology principles—where design follows biological and environmental forces—to the **Material Intelligence Framework**. This informs the design of adaptive boundaries and grown structures. | Supports **Cleansing** by designing for full lifecycles and waste transformation, and **Nourishment** by creating structures that actively produce energy/food. |
| **Liberation** | **Elinor Ostrom's Commons Governance** | Implement Ostrom's 8 design principles for managing common-pool resources as a governance layer for **Grid Completion**. This operationalizes the **Axis of Relational Depth**. | Strengthens **Movement** through clear, participatory rules that circulate power and responsibility, preventing governance stagnation. |
| **Healing** | **Relational-Cultural Theory (RCT)** | Use RCT's "Five Good Things" (increased zest, empowerment, knowledge, worth, desire for more connection) as metrics for healthy **boundary permeability** and indicators of healing in community settings. | Enhances **Nourishment** by framing growth-in-connection as a core human need and **Restoration** by validating mutual empathy as reparative. |

## 3. Frameworks from Cognitive Science & Developmental Psychology

These frameworks provide empirical grounding and mechanistic models for the Mandala's consciousness-first ontology and its developmental architecture.

| Framework | Compatibility Points | Integration Protocol | Dialectical Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robert Lawrence Kuhn's "Landscape of Consciousness"** | Maps over 300 theories of consciousness on a physicalist-to-idealist spectrum, formally situating **Analytic Idealism** within rigorous academic discourse. | Use the landscape to contextualize the Mandala's ontology during **Protocol 1 (Diagnostic Weaving)** when engaging with materialist perspectives. It validates idealism as a coherent scientific position. | Supports the foundational shift in **0D/1D** from a materialist to an idealist self-concept, which is necessary for all subsequent ethical unfolding. |
| **Robert Kegan's Subject-Object Theory (Adult Development)** | Provides an empirically validated model of the "evolution of consciousness" through 5+ stages, each a more complex mental structure. This maps precisely onto the **Dialectical Phases**. | Use Kegan's stage descriptions (Imperial, Socialized, Self-Authoring, Self-Transforming) as a psychological diagnostic lens for assessing an individual's or group's primary **Dimensional** center of gravity during assessment. | Directly mirrors the **Soteriological Axis** and the journey from **0D Point Identity** (Imperial) to **4D Tesseractive Wholeness** (Self-Transforming/Interconnected). |
| **Predictive Processing & 4E Cognitive Science** | Proposes the brain is a "prediction engine" that models the world (a controlled hallucination). This aligns with idealism and explains the **Rhizomatic Network** as an extended mind. | Apply Predictive Processing principles to design learning in the **Rhizomatic Network**. Frame "prediction errors" (new data contradicting the model) as the cognitive driver of **Dialectical Velocity** and phase transitions. | Explains the micro-mechanics of **Feedback Loops**. Learning is the updating of internal models to minimize prediction error, which is the process of navigating the **Temporal Unfolding** spectrum. |
| **Developmental Stage Theories (Kegan, Cook-Greuter, Wilber)** | Provide validated maps of the evolution of adult meaning-making, ego development, and perspective-taking. These map precisely to the increasing complexity and dimensionality of the **Dialectical Phases** and **Geometric Completion** states. | Use stage assessments (e.g., via subject-object interviews or validated surveys) during **Protocol 1 (Diagnostic Weaving)** to establish a group's "center of gravity." This informs which **Pathway** and which phase-appropriate practices will be most effective and avoid bypassing. | The sequence from **1D Linear Narrative** (Imperial/Self-Protective) to **4D Tesseractive Wholeness** (Unitive/Construct-Aware) is empirically validated. Each stage represents a more adequate **structure of consciousness** for navigating the Mandala's ethical axes. |
| **Michael Levin's Scale-Free Cognition & Diverse Intelligence** | Provides a biological foundation for cognition and agency as fundamental, scale-free properties of life, from cells to societies. Validates multi-scale modeling and the concept of expanding "cognitive light cones." | Use the "cognitive light cone" as a diagnostic in **Protocol 1 (Diagnostic Weaving)** to assess the scale of a system's identity and goals. Apply principles of collective intelligence to design interactions in the **Rhizomatic Network**. | Directly maps to the **Soteriological Axis** and the expansion of self. Explains the mechanics of **Geometric Completion** (Seed→Spire) as stages of boundary integration. Provides scientific grounding for cognition in the **ECOLOGY** and **SOCIETY** cubes. |
| **Donald Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception** | Proposes that spacetime and objects are a species-specific "user interface" shaped by evolution, not reality itself. Consciousness (as "conscious agents") is fundamental. | Use as a lens during **Protocol 1 (Diagnostic Weaving)** to question the assumed ontology of a group: "What aspects of reality might our shared 'interface' be hiding or distorting for our current goals?" | Provides an evolutionary and computational rationale for the **epistemic limits** of any single perspective (cube). Aligns with the **Analytic Idealist** ontology that consciousness is primary. |
| **Riddle & Schooler's Nested Observer Windows (NOW) Model** | A hierarchical neuroscience model where conscious awareness arises at a slow, brain-wide scale that integrates information from faster, unconscious sub-windows. | Use the concept of nested windows to design the **Rhizomatic Network** and governance, ensuring information flows effectively between different scales of decision-making (e.g., individual, working group, assembly). | Directly models the **recursive, scalable structure** of the Tesseract. Provides a mechanism for how **higher-dimensional phases** (3D, 4D) integrate and govern lower-level processes. Validates the multi-scale logic of the entire framework. |

## 4. Frameworks from Living Systems & Ecological Design

These frameworks provide the pattern language and practical methodology for creating autopoietic, regenerative systems that are the goal of the Mandala's Axiological Axis and Path of Making.

| Framework | Compatibility Points | Integration Protocol | Dialectical Alignment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Living Systems Theory & Autopoiesis** | Defines life as a self-producing network (autopoiesis) that maintains a boundary and is structurally coupled to its environment. This is the scientific description of a system achieving **Geometric Completion** (Seed, Grid, Web). | Apply autopoiesis as the design goal for all community projects in the **Path of Making**. Assess: "Is this project creating the conditions for its own continued renewal?" Use this to evaluate the health of the **Rhizomatic Network**. | The journey from **0D Dissolution** to **4D Reunification** is a process of increasing autopoietic capacity. A **Spire**-level system is a consciously participatory autopoietic entity. |
| **Biomimicry & Life's Principles** | Provides a design lens based on 3.8 billion years of evolution. Its core ethos—"life creates conditions conducive to life"—is the operational definition of the **Axiological Axis**. | Use Biomimicry's "Life's Principles" (e.g., adapt to changing conditions, use life-friendly chemistry) as a direct checklist during **Protocol 2 (Generative Design)** for any material, economic, or social innovation. | Mirrors the **Dialectical Phases** as a process of learning from and integrating with the intelligence of the natural world (**MAL**), moving from human-centric to ecosystem-centric design. |
| **Symmathesy (Nora Bateson)** | The concept of mutual, contextual learning through interaction. It posits that systems are not just interdependent, but are *composed of* the learning that happens between their parts. | Apply symmathesy to understand and design the **Rhizomatic Network**. Frame data not as objective points, but as artifacts of relational learning. This informs how to design for **healthy feedback loops** and **Boundary Permeability**. | Central to the **Axis of Relational Depth**. It explains how **2D Integration** and **3D Transformation** occur through complex, mutual learning, not linear instruction. |
| **Ontological Design & Design Philosophy** | The principle that "we design our world, and our world designs us" (the recursive loop of design and being). This perfectly mirrors the Mandala's consciousness-first, participative reality. | Apply as the highest-order check in **Protocol 2 (Generative Design)**: "What kind of subjects, relationships, and consciousness is this design calling into being?" Use this to evaluate the ethical depth of any pathway project. | Pervasive. It is the awareness that every act of **Making**, **Liberating**, or **Healing** is fundamentally an act of **world-making** and thus **self-making**, aligning with the entire **Soteriological Axis**. |

## 5. Critical Integration Principles: Maintaining Ontological Coherence

Integrating external frameworks is not eclectic collage. It is a disciplined practice of translation that must honor the Mandala's foundational premises. These principles are filters; any framework must pass through them to be compatible.

1.  **Ontological Integrity (Non-Negotiable):** Any compatible framework must be translatable to or honor **consciousness as primary (Analytic Idealism)**. Frameworks built on strict materialism must be *reinterpreted*. For example, a "system" in Meadows is seen not as a mechanical object but as a stable pattern of conscious relationships.
2.  **Boundary Permeability:** Frameworks that harden dualistic boundaries (mind/body, human/nature, spiritual/practical) require transformation before integration. The integration work is to find the "seam" where the framework's categories can become permeable membranes within the Tesseract's geometry.
3.  **Temporal Wisdom:** Frameworks focused on short-term optimization or infinite growth must be recontextualized within the **Deep Time awareness** of the 3D+ phases. Their tools may be used, but their goals are subordinated to the long-term thrival of the conscious whole.
4.  **Power Circulation:** Any framework that concentrates decision-making, resources, or meaning in a central authority (technical, political, or spiritual) must be redesigned for **circulation and distribution**. Integration often involves "decentralizing" the framework's application.
5.  **Embodied Grounding:** Abstract, purely cognitive frameworks require grounding in the **Four Embodied Foundations** before integration. This often means pairing them with somatic or practical rituals (e.g., combining systems thinking diagrams with physical mapping of a watershed).

## Practical Integration Process: The Translation Protocol

To integrate a new framework not listed here, follow this protocol:

1.  **Identify Primary Resonance:** Does this framework align most clearly with a **Geometric Dimension**, a **Pathway**, or an **Axis**? This determines its "home" in the matrix.
2.  **Test Against Critical Principles:** Run the framework through the five filters above. Where does it conflict? Is the conflict irreconcilable (e.g., rigid materialism) or a matter of emphasis that can be reinterpreted?
3.  **Map Key Concepts:** Translate the framework's core concepts into Mandala terms. What is its equivalent of a "foundation," a "boundary," a "phase transition"?
4.   **Define the Integration Protocol:** Write a clear, actionable statement: "To integrate [Framework X], use its [Tool Y] during [Mandala Protocol Z] to enhance [Mandala Component A]." This turns compatibility into practice.
5.   **Pilot and Rhizomatic Feedback:** Implement the integration in a small, real-world context. Document the process and outcomes in the **Rhizomatic Network**, allowing the community to refine the integration.

This matrix is ever-growing. Its purpose is to show that the Solarpunk Mandala is a **living syntax**, not a finished doctrine—a way to weave together humanity's best tools for understanding and healing into a coherent, conscious, and beautiful pattern.
