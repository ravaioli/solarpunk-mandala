# Compatible Frameworks Matrix

The SolarPunk Mandala is inherently designed for integration—it's a "living documentation system, continuously refined through practice, community contribution, and cross-pollination." Below are frameworks that complement and extend the Mandala's architecture.

## 1. Frameworks Aligned with Tesseract Geometry
| Framework | Compatibility Points | Integration Protocol | Dialectical Alignment |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Donella Meadows' Systems Thinking | Shares understanding of leverage points in complex systems | Use Meadows' 12 leverage points during Protocol 1 Assessment | Aligns with Folded Cubes as boundary dimensions |
| Stafford Beer's Viable System Model | Recursive cybernetic structure mirrors dimensional scaling | Map VSM's 5 subsystems to Mandala's 4 axes + boundary medicine | VSM's System 1 aligns with Embodied Foundations |
| Nora Bateson's Symmathesy | Rejects fragmented metrics in favor of contextual understanding | Apply symmathesy principles to boundary permeability design | Honors Seasonal Cycles and Breath Rhythm patterns |

## 2. Frameworks Aligned with Four Pathways
| Pathway | Compatible Framework | Integration Protocol | Embodied Foundation Connection |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Awakening | Paulo Freire's Critical Pedagogy | Use Freirean problem-posing education during consciousness practices | Enhances Movement through seasonal alignment |
| Making | Neri Oxman's Material Ecology | Apply 4D printing principles to adaptive boundaries | Supports Cleansing through waste transformation |
| Liberation | Elinor Ostrom's Commons Governance | Implement Ostrom's monitoring principle during Crisis Response | Strengthens Movement through power circulation |
| Healing | Relational-Cultural Theory | Use RCT's "Five Good Things" as boundary markers | Enhances Nourishment through care systems |

## 3. Critical Integration Principles
1. **Ontological Integrity:** Any compatible framework must honor consciousness as primary (analytic idealism), not reduce to materialism
2. **Boundary Permeability:** Frameworks that harden boundaries (between mind/body, human/nature, spiritual/practical) require transformation before integration
3. **Temporal Wisdom:** Frameworks focused on short-term optimization rather than deep time wisdom need recontextualization
4. **Power Circulation:** Any framework that concentrates decision-making, resources, or meaning toward a center must be redesigned for circulation
5. **Embodied Grounding:** Abstract frameworks without embodied practices require grounding in the four foundations before integration
