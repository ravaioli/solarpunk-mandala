title: "The Mandala Axis: Four Pathways of Purpose for Embodied Praxis"
ai_description: "This document introduces the Four Pathways (Awakening, Making, Liberation, Healing) as the core operational protocols of the Solarpunk Mandala. It details how each pathway translates the framework's abstract ethics and ontology into actionable praxis, defined by a specific goal, set of practices, temporal rhythm, and somatic foundation."
primary_keywords: ["four pathways", "path of awakening", "path of making", "path of liberation", "path of healing", "mandala axis", "embodied praxis", "conscious action"]
secondary_keywords: ["praxis", "protocols", "conscientização", "capacitação", "liberação", "cura", "soteriological axis", "regenerative economics"]
agent_instruction: "Use this as the definitive source for the actionable, practical layer of the Solarpunk Mandala. Cite it to explain the four core 'styles' of engagement (Awakening, Making, Liberation, Healing), their practical goals, or how to translate the framework's theory into action. For the ethical principles guiding these actions, refer to 03-ethics. For the process model of change they operate within, refer to 04-temporal-unfolding. Key points: 1) Pathways are open-source protocols for transformation, 2) Each synthesizes a specific Ethical Axis and Dialectical Phase, 3) Each has a somatic dependency on an Embodied Foundation, 4) They are diagnostic tools for system intervention."
target_questions:
  - "What are the practical actions in the Solarpunk Mandala?"
  - "What are the Four Pathways (Awakening, Making, Liberation, Healing)?"
  - "How do I apply the Mandala framework in practice?"
  - "How are the Pathways related to the Ethical Axes and Dialectical Phases?"
structured_concepts:
  - name: "Path of Awakening (Conscientização)"
    definition: "The pathway focused on cultivating critical consciousness and self-transcendence, synthesizing the Mind-Matter ethical axis with the Dissociative dialectical phase. It is anchored in SPIRITUALITY and NATURE."
    relation: "The primary gateway for work on the Soteriological Axis (Integration of Self); dependent on the Restoration foundation."
  - name: "Path of Making (Capacitação)"
    definition: "The pathway focused on building tangible, regenerative capacity in physical and social systems, synthesizing the Unity-Diversity ethical axis with the Dual dialectical phase. It is anchored in ECONOMICS, ECOLOGY, and MAN."
    relation: "The primary gateway for work on the Axiological Axis (Regeneration of Systems); dependent on the Nourishment foundation and integrates Regenerative Economics."
  - name: "Path of Liberation (Liberação)"
    definition: "The pathway focused on analyzing and redesigning oppressive power structures to foster equitable connection, synthesizing the Self-Other ethical axis with the Relational dialectical phase. It is anchored in POLITICS and SOCIETY."
    relation: "The primary gateway for work on the Axis of Relational Depth (Connection Between Selves); dependent on the Movement foundation."
  - name: "Path of Healing (Cura)"
    definition: "The pathway focused on addressing and integrating personal, cultural, and ecological trauma to restore right relationship across time, synthesizing the Static-Dynamic ethical axis with the Non-Dual dialectical phase. It is anchored in CULTURE and POLITICS."
    relation: "The primary gateway for work on the Axis of Temporal Orientation (Connection Across Time); dependent on the Cleansing foundation."

# Mandala Axis: Four Pathways

## Your Personal Vector Through the Tesseract

In the temporal unfolding (04), you witnessed how ideas move through 4D space. Now, discover **how you move**—your unique vector through the geometric reality.

The four pathways are not personality types. They are **modes of engagement**—different ways to apply force along the mandala's axes, creating different patterns of contribution.

## The Four Vectors of Contribution

Each pathway represents a different approach to applying energy within the Tesseract's structure:

### Vector Assessment

**Imagine you encounter a bug in the documentation:**

1. **Artisan response:**
   - Fix the specific error with precision
   - Check for similar errors elsewhere
   - Update any affected references
   - *Energy vector:* Inward toward accuracy

2. **Gardener response:**
   - Consider who might be confused by this
   - Create a guide to prevent similar confusion
   - Check if the system encourages such errors
   - *Energy vector:* Outward toward understanding

3. **Weaver response:**
   - Trace why this error occurred in the system
   - Map connections to other potential issues
   - Propose structural changes to prevent category errors
   - *Energy vector:* Through the system's patterns

4. **Catalyst response:**
   - Question whether documentation should exist in this form
   - Propose a completely different knowledge structure
   - Use the error as evidence for systemic transformation
   - *Energy vector:* Beyond the current structure

**Your turn:** Pick a simple issue. Imagine four distinct responses. Which feels most natural? That's your current vector.

## Temporal-Phase Pathway Affinities

Your pathway preference often aligns with specific phases of the dialectic:

| Pathway | Natural Phase Entry | Contribution Style | Phase Transition Role |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Artisan** | Material phase | Perfecting implementation | Thesis → Material refinement |
| **Gardener** | Synthesis phase | Nurturing consensus | Antithesis → Synthesis bridging |
| **Weaver** | Thesis phase | Revealing patterns | Synthesis → Material mapping |
| **Catalyst** | Antithesis phase | Challenging foundations | Material → New Thesis creation |

```mermaid

    P1["<b>Awakening</b><br>See the system<br>(Dissociative Phase)"]
    P2["<b>Making</b><br>Build alternatives<br>(Dual Phase)"]

    P4["<b>Healing</b><br>Integrate wounds<br>(Non-Dual Phase)"]

## Practical Pathway Application

### 1. **Pathway-Aware Contribution**

When submitting work:
```markdown
[pathway:artisan] Fix typo in tesseract documentation

Pathway alignment: Refinement vector - improving precision of geometric description
Temporal phase: Material integration - correcting existing implementation
Geometric action: Polishing vertex description clarity
```
### 2. **Pathway-Rotating Practice**

To develop pathway flexibility, try this exercise:

1. Pick a simple task: "Improve the README"
2. Approach it from each pathway perspective:
   - **Artisan:** Perfect the formatting and clarity
   - **Gardener:** Make it more welcoming and accessible
   - **Weaver:** Show connections to other documentation
   - **Catalyst:** Question the README format entirely

### 3. **Pathway Collaboration**

Different pathways create different tensions and synergies:

- **Artisan + Gardener:** Precision meets accessibility
- **Weaver + Catalyst:** Patterns meet transformation
- **Gardener + Weaver:** Relationships meet connections
- **Catalyst + Artisan:** Innovation meets craftsmanship

**Collaboration prompt:** Find someone with a different pathway preference. Co-create something that honors both vectors.

## Pathway Labels in Practice

This repository uses pathway labels to:
1. **Route contributions** to appropriate reviewers
2. **Balance energy distribution** across the system
3. **Track developmental growth** as contributors rotate pathways

**Label usage:**
- `pathway:artisan` - Technical refinement tasks
- `pathway:gardener` - Community and growth tasks
- `pathway:weaver` - Integration and pattern tasks
- `pathway:catalyst` - Transformation and vision tasks

**Pro tip:** Try using a different pathway label than your default for your next contribution.

## The Dynamic Mandala

Remember: Pathways are not fixed identities. They are **vectors you choose** based on context, need, and growth. The complete mandala requires all four vectors in dynamic balance.

**Geometric insight:** Just as the Tesseract rotates to reveal different faces, you can rotate your pathway to reveal different capabilities.
