# The Mandala Axis: Four Pathways of Purpose

To move through these dimensions, we need actionable pathways. The Mandala Axis provides four universal, open-source protocols—reframed from ancient wisdom for modern, inclusive praxis:

| Pathway | Mutual Goal | Core Practices (from Circles Elements) | Temporal Rhythm | Rhizomatic Anchor | Embodied Threshold |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Path of Awakening | Conscientização (Critical consciousness) | SPIRITUALITY Elements (e.g., Interconnection & Cosmology, Transcendence & Wonder) | Seasonal Cycles (NATURE: Climate) | Spirituality + NATURE | Restoration ≥ 2 (cannot sustain awe on empty stomach) |
| 2. Path of Making | Capacitação (Capacity-building) | ECONOMICS + ECOLOGY Elements (e.g., Production & Resourcing, Embodiment & Sustenance) | Learning Spiral (Iterative reflection) | Economics + Ecology + MAN | Nourishment ≥ 2 (cannot build when hungry) |
| 3. Path of Liberation | Liberação (Systemic freedom) | POLITICS + SOCIETY Elements (e.g., Organization & Governance, Law & Administration) | Project Lifecycle (Design → evaluation) | Politics + SOCIETY | Movement ≥ 2 (cannot liberate when immobilized) |
| 4. Path of Healing | Cura (Relational restoration) | CULTURE + POLITICS Elements (e.g., Enquiry & Learning, Dialogue & Reconciliation) | Breath Rhythm (Tension → release) | Culture + Politics | Cleansing ≥ 2 (cannot heal when toxic) |

## Embodied Integration
Each pathway activates specific embodied foundations:
1. **Awakening** draws on Restoration (through rest and contemplation) and Movement (through seasonal alignment)
2. **Making** draws on Nourishment (through production systems) and Cleansing (through waste transformation)
3. **Liberation** draws on Movement (through power circulation) and Cleansing (through accountability systems)
4. **Healing** draws on Restoration (through repair processes) and Nourishment (through care systems)

## Key Integration Principle
These pathways are not spiritual doctrines but functional protocols. Their activation depends on the stability of their embodied foundations. When foundations weaken, the system contracts to survival mode regardless of pathway intentions.
