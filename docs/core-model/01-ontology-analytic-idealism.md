# Ontological Ground: Analytic Idealism

The framework begins with Analytic Idealism—the proposition that consciousness is the sole ontological primitive. This view resolves the 'hard problem' of consciousness by honoring the primacy of direct experience. Reality is not a dead universe of matter that accidentally produced mind. Instead, Mind at Large (MAL) is the singular, undifferentiated field of awareness from which all experience arises. While this ontology guides our practice, the framework maintains methodological openness to empirical research on consciousness efficacy that may operate with different metaphysical assumptions while arriving at compatible practical insights about agency and transformation.

## Core Propositions

1. **Individual minds are not emergent properties of brains, but dissociated alters within MAL**—akin to personalities in a single psyche, each with its own boundary of experience.

2. **The physical world—including bodies, ecosystems, and cities—is the extrinsic appearance of inner dynamics within MAL.** What we measure as "matter" is how consciousness looks from across a dissociative boundary.

This view resolves the "hard problem" of consciousness, honors the primacy of direct experience, and aligns with findings in quantum physics, predictive processing neuroscience, and the phenomenology of non-ordinary states (e.g., near-death experiences, deep meditation).

## Analytic Idealism Integration Protocol

To prevent philosophical-materialist slippage in practical applications, all protocols must include Dissociation Lens questions:

### Dissociation Lens Framework
- **Core Question:** "This work addresses [specific dissociation boundary]. How does this practice help dissolve the boundary between [individual] and Mind at Large?"
- **Boundary Medicine:** Identify which folded cube (5-8) this work heals
- **MAL Reflection:** "How does this action connect us to the larger field of consciousness? What boundary might this heal?"

### Implementation Requirements
1. All protocol worksheets must include Dissociation Lens questions
2. All case studies must explicitly reference MAL integration
3. Crisis response must include "Consciousness First Aid" step addressing boundary fragmentation before material response
4. Material intelligence framework must reframe materials as "consciousness made visible"

### Example Integration (Protocol 3 Crisis Response)
Instead of: "Distribute food and water to affected areas"  
Add: "Distribute food and water while facilitating collective grounding practices that address the dissociation between individual survival and collective care. How does this emergency response help us remember our belonging to Mind at Large even in crisis?"
