# Solarpunk Mandala: Core Model Documentation

Welcome to the core conceptual architecture of the Solarpunk Mandala. This documentation details a comprehensive, integrative model for conscious transformation—a **geometric and ontological framework** for navigating the transition toward regenerative, equitable, and beautiful futures.

The Mandala is built on the foundation of **Analytic Idealism**, positing consciousness as the fundamental reality. From this starting point, it develops an **epistemic geometry** (the Tesseract), an **ethical compass** (the Four Axes), and **practical pathways** for embodied action, all designed to work as a coherent, scalable system.

## 📐 Conceptual Architecture: A Guided Journey

The core model is structured as a conceptual journey, where each document builds upon the last, unfolding the system from its first principles to its practical applications. It is designed to be explored sequentially.

### 1. Foundation: Meta-Framework, Ontology & Epistemology
These documents establish the *systems science context*, the *why*, and the *how* of the model—the meta-discipline, philosophical ground, and structural lens.

*   **[00 - Meta-Framework: Systems & Cybernetics](./00-meta-framework-systems-cybernetics.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Positions the Mandala within the transdisciplinary sciences of **General Systems Theory (structure)** and **Cybernetics (process)**, with Michael Levin's **scale-free cognition** providing the layer of agency. Establishes the model as a rigorous synthesis for conscious systems design.
*   **[01 - Ontology: Analytic Idealism](./01-ontology-analytic-idealism.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Establishes the fundamental premise: consciousness is primary. This "consciousness-first" starting point addresses the limits of materialism and provides a coherent ground for values, meaning, and agency. Includes analyses of **altered states, transpersonal mentations, and UAPs** as experiential validations of the ontology.
*   **[02 - Epistemic Architecture: The Tesseract](./02-epistemic-architecture-tesseract.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduces the 4D hypercube (Tesseract) as the central geometric metaphor for managing complexity and multiple perspectives. Now includes **scale-free cognition** as scientific validation for its multi-scale logic.

### 2. Core: Ethics, Time, & Pathways
This section defines the core dynamics of change—the ethical directions of growth, the temporal stages of development, and the actionable gateways for intervention.

*   **[03 - Ethics: The Four Axes of Transformation](./03-ethics-four-axes.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the four primary ethical dimensions (Soteriological, Axiological, Relational Depth, Temporal Orientation) that guide transformation. Introduces the **Embodied Foundations** and the critical **Threshold Principle**.
*   **[04 - Temporal Unfolding: Dialectical Phases](./04-temporal-unfolding-dialectical-phases.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Maps the universal journey of systems across six dimensions (-1D to 4D), from dissolution to reunification. Details the **Dialectical Velocity Metric**.
*   **[05 - The Mandala Axis: Four Pathways of Purpose](./05-mandala-axis-four-pathways.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Translates the ethical axes into four actionable protocols: Awakening, Making, Liberation, and Healing. Now frames pathways as technologies for expanding **cognitive light cones**.

### 3. Expression: Intelligence, Matter, & Integration
Here, the abstract model meets the tangible world, detailing the frameworks for material practice, personal/collective capacity, and integration with external knowledge systems.

*   **[06 - Geometric Completion: The Tesseract](./06-geometric-completion-tesseract.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Describes the four archetypal states of systemic wholeness (Seed, Grid, Web, Spire) and introduces the **Alpha (α) Metric** for measuring integration.
*   **[07 - Material Intelligence Framework](./07-material-intelligence-framework.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Applies the ontology to the physical realm, framing materials as expressions of conscious intelligence. Provides bioregional guidelines and the principle of **Dialectical Boundary Permeability**.
*   **[08 - Multiple Intelligences Framework](./08-multiple-intelligences-framework.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Expands the concept of intelligence into eight embodied capacities aligned with the Tesseract's cubes, charting their development through dialectical phases.
*   **[09 - Compatible Frameworks Matrix](./09-compatible-frameworks-matrix.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Demonstrates the integrative power of the Mandala by mapping how external frameworks (e.g., Systems Thinking, Viable System Model, Michael Levin's work, Cognitive Science) align with its geometry and pathways.
*   **[10 - Cybernetic Foundations](./10-cybernetic-foundations.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides the operational principles of regulation, feedback, and adaptation for conscious systems, explaining how the Mandala functions as a participatory control system.

## 🧭 How to Navigate This Documentation

*   **For First-Time Readers:** Proceed in numerical order (`00` → `12`). The model is designed to build concepts sequentially from meta-framework to application and critique.
*   **For Systems Thinkers & Designers:** Begin with the **Foundation** section (`00`, `01`, `02`), then delve into **Cybernetics (10)** and **Geometric Completion (06)** to understand the operational and structural logic.
*   **For Practitioners Seeking Application:** Focus on the **Core** section (**Pathways (05)** are key) and **Expression** section (**Material Intelligence (07)**, **Multiple Intelligences (08)**) after grasping the core Axes (03) and Phases (04).
*   **For Theorists & Integrators:** The entire **Foundation** and **Expression** sections provide the philosophical depth, scientific grounding, and integrative capacity. The **Frameworks Matrix (09)** is a central hub.

### Logical Architecture of the Core Model

## 🔗 The Living System

The Solarpunk Mandala is not a static blueprint but a **living documentation system**. Its concepts are refined through practice, community contribution, and continuous cross-pollination with other wisdom traditions and sciences. This core model provides the stable architecture for that ongoing, creative evolution.
