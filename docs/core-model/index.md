# Solarpunk Mandala: Core Model Documentation

Welcome to the core conceptual architecture of the Solarpunk Mandala. This documentation details a comprehensive, integrative model for conscious transformation—a **geometric and ontological framework** for navigating the transition toward regenerative, equitable, and beautiful futures.

The Mandala is built on the foundation of **Analytic Idealism**, positing consciousness as the fundamental reality. From this starting point, it develops an **epistemic geometry** (the Tesseract), an **ethical compass** (the Four Axes), and **practical pathways** for embodied action, all designed to work as a coherent, scalable system.

## 🧭 Choose Your Entry Path

The Mandala is designed for multiple learning styles and goals. Choose your path below:

| Path | Who It’s For | Recommended Start | Key Documents |
|------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **🧠 Theorist / Researcher** | Academics, systems thinkers, philosophers | 00 → 01 → 02 → 10 | Foundation & Cybernetics |
| **🛠️ Practitioner / Designer** | Community organizers, facilitators, activists | 03 → 05 → 07 → 08 | Pathways & Material/Multiple Intelligences |
| **🌱 Community Facilitator** | Co-op leaders, educators, workshop designers | 05 → 09 → 03 | Protocols, Assessments, Case Studies |

## 📐 Conceptual Architecture: A Guided Journey

The core model is structured as a conceptual journey, where each document builds upon the last, unfolding the system from its first principles to its practical applications. It is designed to be explored sequentially.

### 1. Foundation: Meta-Framework, Ontology & Epistemology
These documents establish the *systems science context*, the *why*, and the *how* of the model—the meta-discipline, philosophical ground, and structural lens.

*   **[00 - Meta-Framework: Systems & Cybernetics](./00-meta-framework-systems-cybernetics.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 15 min*  
    **Purpose:** Positions the Mandala within the transdisciplinary sciences of **General Systems Theory (structure)** and **Cybernetics (process)**, with Michael Levin's **scale-free cognition** providing the layer of agency. Establishes the model as a rigorous synthesis for conscious systems design.  
    **🛠️ In Practice:** Learn to see any system—personal, social, ecological—as a feedback-driven, goal-directed entity.

*   **[01 - Ontology: Analytic Idealism](./01-ontology-analytic-idealism.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 20 min*  
    **Purpose:** Establishes the fundamental premise: consciousness is primary. This "consciousness-first" starting point addresses the limits of materialism and provides a coherent ground for values, meaning, and agency. Includes analyses of **altered states, transpersonal mentations, and UAPs** as experiential validations of the ontology.  
    **🛠️ In Practice:** Shift from “How does matter create mind?” to “How does consciousness express as matter?”

*   **[02 - Epistemic Architecture: The Tesseract](./02-epistemic-architecture-tesseract.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 25 min*  
    **Purpose:** Introduces the 4D hypercube (Tesseract) as the central geometric metaphor for managing complexity and multiple perspectives. Now includes **scale-free cognition** as scientific validation for its multi-scale logic.  

### 2. Core: Ethics, Time, & Pathways
This section defines the core dynamics of change—the ethical directions of growth, the temporal stages of development, and the actionable gateways for intervention.

*   **[03 - Ethics: The Four Axes of Transformation](./03-ethics-four-axes.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 18 min*  
    **Purpose:** Defines the four primary ethical dimensions (Soteriological, Axiological, Relational Depth, Temporal Orientation) that guide transformation. Introduces the **Embodied Foundations** and the critical **Threshold Principle**.  

*   **[04 - Temporal Unfolding: Dialectical Phases](./04-temporal-unfolding-dialectical-phases.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 22 min*  
    **Purpose:** Maps the universal journey of systems across six dimensions (-1D to 4D), from dissolution to reunification. Details the **Dialectical Velocity Metric**.  
    **📈 Metric Example:** A healthy community might score 0.6–0.8 on dialectical velocity.

*   **[05 - The Mandala Axis: Four Pathways of Purpose](./05-mandala-axis-four-pathways.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 20 min*  
    **Purpose:** Translates the ethical axes into four actionable protocols: Awakening, Making, Liberation, and Healing. Now frames pathways as technologies for expanding **cognitive light cones**.  

### 3. Expression: Intelligence, Matter, & Integration
Here, the abstract model meets the tangible world, detailing the frameworks for material practice, personal/collective capacity, and integration with external knowledge systems.

*   **[06 - Geometric Unpacking: The Tesseract](./06-geometric-unpacking-tesseract.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 15 min*  
    **Purpose:** Describes the four archetypal states of systemic wholeness (Seed, Grid, Web, Spire) and introduces the **Alpha (α) Metric** for measuring integration.  

*   **[07 - Material Intelligence Framework](./07-material-intelligence-framework.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 18 min*  
    **Purpose:** Applies the ontology to the physical realm, framing materials as expressions of conscious intelligence. Provides bioregional guidelines and the principle of **Dialectical Boundary Permeability**.  
    **🌿 Example:** Mycelium networks as 3D material intelligence.

*   **[08 - Multiple Intelligences Framework](./08-multiple-intelligences-framework.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 20 min*  
    **Purpose:** Expands the concept of intelligence into eight embodied capacities aligned with the Tesseract's cubes, charting their development through dialectical phases.  

*   **[09 - Compatible Frameworks Matrix](./09-compatible-frameworks-matrix.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 12 min*  
    **Purpose:** Demonstrates the integrative power of the Mandala by mapping how external frameworks (e.g., Systems Thinking, Viable System Model, Michael Levin's work, Cognitive Science) align with its geometry and pathways.  

*   **[10 - Cybernetic Foundations](./10-cybernetic-foundations.md)**  
    *📄 Read time: 15 min*  
    **Purpose:** Provides the operational principles of regulation, feedback, and adaptation for conscious systems, explaining how the Mandala functions as a participatory control system.  
    **🔄 In Practice:** Learn to design feedback loops that respect Threshold Principles.
