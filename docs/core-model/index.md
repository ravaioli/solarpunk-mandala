# Core Model: The Living Geometry of Belonging

The SolarPunk Mandala is not a theoretical construct—it is a living geometry of belonging, grounded in a single, transformative insight and operationalized through a six-part system of practice. At its heart lies a coherent progression from ontology (what is real) and epistemology (how we know), which inform ethics (how we act), and ultimately define the praxis (how we build, remember, and integrate).

## Core Components

1. **[Ontological Ground: Analytic Idealism](01-ontology-analytic-idealism.md)**  
   The proposition that consciousness is the sole ontological primitive, resolving the hard problem of consciousness by honoring the primacy of direct experience.

2. **[Epistemic Architecture: The Tesseract](02-epistemic-architecture-tesseract.md)**  
   A four-dimensional hypercube used as a cognitive prosthetic to map the eight cubes of epistemic access, which are observed and integrated from the Central Core (Ø).

3. **[Ethical Dimensions: The Four Axes of Transformation](03-ethics-four-axes.md)**  
   The Tesseract orients not just knowing, but becoming. Transformation unfolds along four orthogonal ethical axes, each measurable through the Rhizomatic Network.

4. **[Temporal Unfolding: From -1D to 4D](04-temporal-unfolding-dialectical-phases.md)**  
   All four axes unfold across the same dimensional spectrum, mapping the journey from dissociation to reintegration.

5. **[The Mandala Axis: Four Pathways of Purpose](05-mandala-axis-four-pathways.md)**  
   To move through these dimensions, we need actionable pathways. The Mandala Axis provides four universal, open-source protocols—reframed from ancient wisdom for modern, inclusive praxis.

6. **[Geometric Completion: The Full Tesseract](06-geometric-completion-tesseract.md)**  
   The model's geometry is now complete with Embodied Foundations at its center.

7. **[Material Intelligence Framework](07-material-intelligence-framework.md)**  
   Material Intelligence refers to the wisdom of selecting and working with materials that respond intelligently to local environmental conditions while serving multiple functions simultaneously.

8. **[Multiple Intelligences Framework](08-multiple-intelligences-framework.md)**  
   The Mandala's strength lies in its capacity to integrate multiple forms of intelligence beyond conventional rational paradigms.

9. **[Compatible Frameworks Matrix](09-compatible-frameworks-matrix.md)**  
   The SolarPunk Mandala is inherently designed for integration—it's a "living documentation system, continuously refined through practice, community contribution, and cross-pollination."

## Key Integration Principle

These components are not separate parts but interdependent aspects of a unified whole. The Embodied Foundations (Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, Movement) form the functional core from which all other dimensions emerge. When any foundation is compromised, the entire system contracts dimensionally toward survival mode (0D). When all foundations are strong, the system has the stability to unfold toward higher dimensions of complexity and coherence (3D+).
