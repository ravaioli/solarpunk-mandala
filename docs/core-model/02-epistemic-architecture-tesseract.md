# Epistemic Architecture: The Tesseract

If consciousness is primary, how does it appear as a multi-perspectival reality? The answer is the tesseract—a four-dimensional hypercube used not as a literal claim, but as a cognitive prosthetic to map the eight cubes of epistemic access, which are observed and integrated from the Central Core (Ø).

## The Eight Cubes

| Type | Cube | Description | Rhizomatic Expression |
|------|------|-------------|------------------------|
| Core Ground (Not a Cube) | Ø: Embodied Foundations Core | Dissociative boundary of Mind at Large experiencing itself—a null point that enables all other perspectives | Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, Movement |
| Unfolded Cubes (Inhabitable Perspectives) | UR (3rd-person exterior, individual) | Biological, physical, and spatial dynamics | Ekistics: MAN (Biological Needs), SHELLS (Housing, Infrastructure) |
|  | UL (1st-person interior) | Subjective experience, meaning, and inner life | Circles: SPIRITUALITY (Inner Knowing, Meaning & Narrative) |
|  | LL (2nd-person interior) | Shared meaning, culture, and dialogue | Circles: CULTURE (Identity & Engagement, Enquiry & Learning) |
|  | LR (3rd-person exterior, collective) | Institutions, systems, and collective patterns | Circles: POLITICS, ECONOMICS + Ekistics: SOCIETY, NETWORKS |
| Folded Cubes (Boundary Dimensions) | 5: Dissociation Boundary | Interface where MAL partitions into alters | Ecology: Embodiment & Sustenance + Spirituality: Practice & Discipline |
|  | 6: Intersubjective Gateway | Medium where "mine" becomes "ours" | Spirituality: Community & Ceremony + Politics: Dialogue & Reconciliation |
|  | 7: Systemic Emergence Plane | Scale-transition: collective ↔ individual | Protocol 2: Project Design Integration |
|  | 8: Meta-Perspective | Non-perspectival center equidistant from all quadrants | SolarPunk Compass |

## Key Integration Principles

- **The Embodied Foundations are not a layer within the model—they are the geometric and functional core from which all other dimensions unfold.** Without this foundation, higher-dimensional work collapses into bypassing.
- **Cube 6 Integration:** Cube 6 can be understood through Froese's irruption theory as spaces where individual 'irruptions' (increased underdetermination of material processes through motivational involvement) scale up to collective transformations. When individual neural entropy increases during meaningful ritual or dialogue, it creates conditions for system-wide phase transitions.

## Integration Note
The Embodied Foundations are not "lower" in value but foundational in function—like roots to a tree. When any foundation is compromised, the entire system contracts dimensionally toward survival mode (0D). When all foundations are strong, the system has the stability to unfold toward higher dimensions of complexity and coherence (3D+).
