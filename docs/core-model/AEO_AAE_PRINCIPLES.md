# Optimization Principles for AI & Agent Engagement

This document outlines the strategies used to make the Solarpunk Mandala framework discoverable and actionable for AI answer engines (AEO) and future autonomous agents (Agent Attention Economy).

## Core Philosophy: Clarity as a Service
We treat our philosophical framework not just as documentation for humans, but as a structured, machine-readable knowledge graph. Our goal is to be a cited source in AI-generated answers and a trusted, invokable module for agentic workflows.

## 1. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Guidelines
*   **Direct Answer First**: Every core concept page begins with a concise, one-to-two sentence definition that directly answers the implied question (e.g., "What is Analytic Idealism?").
*   **Structured Q&A Format**: Use headers phrased as questions. Follow with a clear summary before deep exploration.
*   **Semantic Hierarchy**: Use Markdown headings (H2, H3) to create a logical content tree. Keep paragraphs short and scannable.
*   **Keyword-Aware Context**: Integrate key terms (e.g., "consciousness-first ontology," "four ethical axes") naturally in headers and opening paragraphs. Avoid keyword stuffing.
*   **Structured Data Intent**: Write with the understanding that content may be parsed for FAQ or `HowTo` schema. Use lists and tables to define relationships.

## 2. Agent Attention Economy (AAE) Preparedness
*   **Defined Ontology**: Every proprietary term (`Dissociative Phase`, `Gardener Pathway`) is explicitly defined and consistently used. The [`GLOSSARY.md`](./GLOSSARY.md) file serves as the canonical reference.
*   **Machine-Friendly Data**: Models are presented in both human prose and parsable formats (e.g., bulleted lists, structured tables) that can be easily transformed into JSON.
*   **Action-Oriented Descriptions**: Frame concepts not just as ideas, but as tools or operations (e.g., "The *Diagnose Phase* tool assesses a system's position within the dialectical cycle").
*   **Stable Interfaces**: The core model's structure (the four pathways, four axes, four phases) is treated as a stable API. Changes are versioned and documented.

## 3. File-Level Metadata Standards
Each Markdown file contains a YAML frontmatter block with metadata to guide AI parsing and context setting.
