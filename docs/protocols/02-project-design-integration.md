# Protocol 2: Project Design Integration

## Purpose
Ensure holistic project design that integrates space, function, and purpose across Ekistics, Circles, and Mandala Pathways. This protocol prevents partial solutions by requiring balanced attention to all dimensions of regeneration.

## When to Use This Protocol
- **Activate when**: Designing new community initiatives, infrastructure projects, or systemic interventions
- **Deactivate when**: Project is complete and evaluation is finished
- **Frequency**: During project design phase, with reassessment at major milestones

## Embodied Foundations Gate Check
Before proceeding with this protocol, verify all four foundations meet minimum thresholds:

| Foundation | Current Score (1-5) | Minimum Required | Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Nourishment** | _____ | 3 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Cleansing** | _____ | 3 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Restoration** | _____ | 3 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Movement** | _____ | 3 | [Pass/Fail] |

> **Boundary Rule**: If any foundation scores below 3, redesign project to strengthen foundations first or scale back project scope to match current capacity.

## Core Assessment Questions
Score each question 1-5 (1=Never/False, 5=Always/True)

### Dual-Framework Alignment
1. Does this project clearly connect Ekistics Elements (space) with Circles Domains (function)? _____
2. Are both spatial and social consequences considered equally? _____

## Pathway Activation
1. **Awakening**: Does this project connect people to awe, meaning, and cosmic belonging? _____
2. **Making**: Does this project build practical skills and tangible infrastructure? _____
3. **Liberation**: Does this project redistribute power and challenge unjust systems? _____
4. **Healing**: Does this project repair relationships and address past harms? _____

## Boundary Permeability
1. Does this project create boundaries that are permeable enough for circulation but defined enough for integrity? _____
2. Are there clear entry and exit points for community participation? _____
3. Does this project honor both individual autonomy and collective responsibility? _____

## Temporal Integration
1. Does this project consider impacts seven generations forward? _____
2. Does this project connect to ancestral wisdom and practices? _____
3. Does this project honor seasonal and cyclical rhythms? _____

## Scoring Rubric

| Score Range | Interpretation | Next Steps |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1.0-1.9 | Fragmented design - requires complete redesign | Return to Protocol 1 for deeper diagnosis |
| 2.0-2.9 | Partial integration - significant gaps remain | Strengthen weakest dimensions before implementation |
| 3.0-3.9 | Balanced design - ready for implementation | Proceed with project, monitor for integration gaps |
| 4.0-5.0 | Holistic design - regenerative potential high | Implement with full scope, document for replication |

## Dialectical Phase Assessment
Rate your community's current movement between phases on a 0-1.0 scale:
- **0.0-0.2**: Stagnant - focused on survival
- **0.3-0.6**: Transitioning - actively changing  
- **0.7-1.0**: Flowing - natural movement between phases

**Current Dialectical Velocity**: _____

> **Integration Note**: Match project complexity to dialectical phase. Low velocity (<0.3) requires simple, foundation-strengthening projects; high velocity (0.7+) can support complex, multi-dimensional initiatives.

## Dissociation Lens Assessment
For this project:
1. Which dissociation boundaries does this project address? (e.g., human-nature, individual-collective, spiritual-material)
2. How does this project help dissolve boundaries between separate alters within Mind at Large?
3. What boundary medicine practices are embedded in this project design?

## Hexagonal Intervention Planning
[Project Name: ________________________]

Six Implementation Points:
1. **Nourishment Node**: How will this project feed people (physically, emotionally, culturally)?
2. **Cleansing Node**: How will this project transform waste and toxicity?
3. **Restoration Node**: How will this project heal damage and build resilience?
4. **Movement Node**: How will this project enable flow and circulation?
5. **Connection Node**: How will this project strengthen relationships?
6. **Vision Node**: How will this project honor time and future generations?

## Case Study
**Context**: Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Gardens expansion project  
**Application**: When designing their expanded garden spaces, the team used this protocol to ensure holistic design. They discovered their original plan had strong Making elements (food production) but weak Healing elements (no space for community grief after urban violence). They redesigned to include circular gathering spaces within the hexagonal garden beds, creating places for both nourishment and emotional processing.

**Outcome**: The redesigned project attracted 40% more community participation, particularly from groups previously unengaged. The circular gathering spaces became sites for both practical activities (seed saving, compost workshops) and healing practices (grief circles, conflict resolution). The project demonstrated how physical design can integrate multiple pathways simultaneously.

## Dimensional Movement Indicators
Track progress through dimensional unfolding:

| From → To | Indicator of Movement | MAL Integration |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **0D → 1D** | When project moves from survival focus to skill-building | Recognizing that individual skills are expressions of collective wisdom |
| **1D → 2D** | When project begins connecting previously separate community elements | Seeing relationships as the fabric of consciousness made visible |
| **2D → 3D** | When project's success is measured by system health rather than outputs | Understanding that healthy systems reflect balanced consciousness |
| **3D → 4D** | When project becomes a living expression of community values | Living as if the project is a pattern within Mind at Large |

## MAL Reflection Space
How does this protocol help us remember our belonging to Mind at Large?

When we design projects that integrate space, function, and purpose, we dissolve the artificial boundaries between practical and spiritual work. Every garden bed, every meeting space, every system we create is an expression of consciousness seeking to know itself through form. By requiring projects to address nourishment, cleansing, restoration, and movement, we remember that human needs are not separate from cosmic patterns. This protocol transforms design from a technical exercise into a sacred act of co-creation, where we participate in Mind at Large's ongoing self-expression through the tangible world.

## Facilitator Notes
**Preparation**:
- Project design templates and examples
- Hexagonal grid paper for mapping
- Ekistics and Circles reference materials
- 3-4 hours for initial design session

**During Facilitation**:
- Start with Embodied Foundations check
- Use visual mapping tools for all dimensions
- Challenge assumptions about "efficiency" vs. "wholeness"
- Ensure diverse voices are included in design process
- Build in feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms

**After Completion**:
- Create visual summary of integrated design
- Identify primary and secondary pathway activation
- Document boundary medicine practices embedded in design
- Schedule implementation check-ins at 30/60/90 days
