# Protocol 3: Crisis Response Framework

## Purpose
Navigate emergencies while protecting the regenerative core and maintaining foundation stability. This protocol ensures that crisis response strengthens rather than undermines long-term community resilience.

## When to Use This Protocol
- **Activate when**: Natural disasters, economic shocks, health emergencies, violence, or any event that threatens community foundations
- **Deactivate when**: Immediate crisis is resolved and foundations are stable (all ≥2)
- **Frequency**: As needed during emergencies, with daily reassessment

## Embodied Foundations Gate Check
Before proceeding with this protocol, verify all four foundations meet minimum thresholds:

| Foundation | Current Score (1-5) | Minimum Required | Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Nourishment** | _____ | 1 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Cleansing** | _____ | 1 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Restoration** | _____ | 1 | [Pass/Fail] |
| **Movement** | _____ | 1 | [Pass/Fail] |

> **Boundary Rule**: Even in extreme crisis, these minimum thresholds must be met for responders. No one can effectively help others while their own foundations are completely collapsed.

## Core Assessment Questions
Score each question 1-5 (1=Never/False, 5=Always/True)

### Immediate Foundation Assessment
1. **Nourishment**: Food/water access right now? _____
2. **Cleansing**: Hygiene/safety from toxins right now? _____
3. **Restoration**: Sleep/safety to rest right now? _____
4. **Movement**: Ability to move safely right now? _____

### Crisis Response Assessment
1. **Safety**: Who needs immediate physical protection? _____
2. **Communication**: How effectively is information flowing to all affected? _____
3. **Resources**: What critical resources are immediately available? _____
4. **Connection**: Who is isolated and needs checking on? _____
5. **Decision-making**: Who has authority to make rapid decisions? _____

### Systemic Vulnerability Assessment
1. Which pre-existing fragilities is this crisis exposing? _____
2. Which relationships are being strained or broken? _____
3. Which systems are failing that were already weak? _____
4. Which unexpected strengths are emerging? _____

## Scoring Rubric

| Score Range | Response Priority | Time Horizon | Decision Structure |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **0-1.0** | Survival needs (food, water, shelter) | Hours | Centralized authority |
| **1.1-2.0** | Communication and information flow | Days | Clear chain of command |
| **2.1-3.0** | Relationship maintenance and community cohesion | Weeks | Consensus with facilitators |
| **3.1-5.0** | System redesign and regeneration | Months+ | Distributed leadership |

## Dialectical Phase Assessment
Rate your community's current movement between phases on a 0-1.0 scale:
- **0.0-0.2**: Stagnant - focused on survival
- **0.3-0.6**: Transitioning - actively changing  
- **0.7-1.0**: Flowing - natural movement between phases

**Current Dialectical Velocity**: _____

> **Integration Note**: Crisis often resets dialectical velocity to 0.0-0.2. Track velocity daily during response to know when to shift strategies.

## Dissociation Lens Assessment
For this crisis:
1. Which dissociation boundaries is this crisis revealing or intensifying? (e.g., safety-fear, individual-collective, present-future)
2. How can our response help heal these boundaries rather than reinforce them?
3. What boundary medicine practices can we integrate even in emergency response? (e.g., collective breathing before decision-making)

## Hexagonal Emergency Response Plan
[Crisis Type: ________________________]

Six Response Points:
1. **Center Point**: What is the absolute core need right now? (Usually a foundation)
2. **Safety Point**: Who needs immediate physical protection?
3. **Communication Point**: How will information flow to all affected?
4. **Resource Point**: What resources are immediately available?
5. **Connection Point**: Who will check on isolated community members?
6. **Decision Point**: Who has authority to make rapid decisions?

## Case Study
**Context**: Puerto Rico Hurricane Response mutual aid networks  
**Application**: After Hurricane Maria, mutual aid networks used this protocol to organize response. Their initial assessment showed all foundations below 1.5. They focused 100% on foundation stabilization (water, food, medical care) for first two weeks, then gradually shifted to 70/30 split as foundations improved. Their hexagonal response hubs allowed different teams to handle specific needs while maintaining connection. Recovery integration revealed that electricity systems were fragile but community relationships were strong, leading to solar microgrids managed by neighborhood councils.

**Outcome**: By following foundation-first response, they avoided burnout and maintained community cohesion throughout the long recovery. The hexagonal structure allowed for both specialization and coordination, while the focus on relationship strength led to more resilient infrastructure solutions that honored local knowledge and autonomy.

## Dimensional Movement Indicators
Track progress through dimensional unfolding:

| From → To | Indicator of Movement | MAL Integration |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **0D → 1D** | When immediate survival needs are met and communication systems function | Recognizing that survival needs connect us to universal patterns of care |
| **1D → 2D** | When community members begin organizing themselves without external direction | Seeing self-organization as expression of collective intelligence |
| **2D → 3D** | When response activities begin rebuilding stronger than before | Understanding that crisis can reveal deeper patterns of resilience |
| **3D → 4D** | When crisis response transforms into prevention and regeneration systems | Living as if crisis and renewal are expressions of the same consciousness |

## MAL Reflection Space
How does this protocol help us remember our belonging to Mind at Large?

In crisis, the illusion of separation intensifies—some are safe while others suffer, some have resources while others lack. This protocol reminds us that crisis reveals our fundamental interdependence. When we respond to emergency by first stabilizing foundations for all, we honor the truth that no one is separate from the whole. Even in the most chaotic moments, we can create islands of coherence where people remember they belong to each other. This isn't just practical strategy; it's spiritual practice that dissolves the boundaries between "helper" and "helped," recognizing that in times of crisis, we all return to the same ground of being—Mind at Large experiencing itself through the full spectrum of human experience.

## Facilitator Notes
**Preparation**:
- Emergency contact lists and communication systems
- Basic supplies for responders (food, water, first aid)
- Clear roles and responsibilities defined in advance
- 24/7 availability during active crisis

**During Facilitation**:
- Begin with foundation assessment for responders first
- Use simple, concrete language—avoid jargon
- Rotate leadership to prevent burnout
- Create brief moments of collective grounding (30-second breath together)
- Document decisions and actions in real-time

**After Completion**:
- Conduct thorough debrief within 48 hours of crisis stabilization
- Assess which foundations were most damaged and need ongoing support
- Identify which relationships and systems were strengthened
- Update emergency plans based on lessons learned
- Schedule community healing ceremony within 2 weeks
