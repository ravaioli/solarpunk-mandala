# Appendix D: Tesseract Geometry Operational Guide

## Introduction
The tesseract is not abstract theory—it is the operational geometry of transformation. This guide provides practical tools for navigating the 16 vertices, 32 edges, 24 faces, and 8 cubes that form the Mandala's structural framework.

## D.1 16 Vertices = Pathway × Ekistics Vocations

| Pathway ↓ \ Ekistics → | NATURE | MAN | SOCIETY | SHELLS |
|------------------------|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| **Awakening** | Ecological Awe Steward | Contemplative Guide | Cultural Ceremony Weaver | Sacred Space Tender |
| **Making** | Regenerative Ecologist | Embodied Resilience Builder | Community Organizer | Regenerative Builder |
| **Liberation** | Earth Jurisprudence Advocate | Care System Designer | Participatory Governance Architect | Commons Infrastructure Planner |
| **Healing** | Eco-Therapist | Trauma-Informed Facilitator | Restorative Justice Mediator | Inclusive Design Advocate |

**Use**: The SolarPunk Compass maps users to vertices using Circles + Ekistics Elements.

## D.2 32 Edges = 4 Pathways × 8 Practices
1. **7 Core Practices** = the 7 Elements of the relevant Circles Domain
2. **+1 Integrative "Offering"** = Transcendence & Wonder (Spirituality)
3. **Use**: Path C modules activate edges via Protocol 2.

## D.3 24 Faces = Ekistics × Circles Cross-Walk
1. **Primary (5)**: As defined in Section 4 of Rhizomatic Doc
   - NATURE-ECOLOGY, MAN-SPIRITUALITY, SOCIETY-POLITICS, SHELLS-ECONOMICS, NETWORKS-CULTURE
2. **Secondary (10)**: As defined in Section 4
   - NATURE-SPIRITUALITY, NATURE-CULTURE, etc.
3. **Tertiary (9)**: e.g., Politics–NETWORKS, Economics–MAN, Spirituality–SOCIETY
4. **Use**: Rhizomatic Connection Map (Artifact 1) scores all 24.

## D.4 8 Cubes = Epistemic Access
1. **Unfolded Cubes**:
   - **UR/MAN+SHELLS**: Physical, biological, spatial dynamics
   - **UL/Spirituality**: Subjective experience, meaning, inner life
   - **LL/Culture**: Shared meaning, culture, dialogue
   - **LR/Politics+Economics+NETWORKS+SOCIETY**: Institutions, systems, collective patterns
2. **Folded Cubes**:
   - **Cube 5**: Ecology Embodiment & Sustenance + Spirituality Practice & Discipline
   - **Cube 6**: Spirituality Community & Ceremony + Politics Dialogue & Reconciliation
   - **Cube 7**: Protocol 2 (Project Design Integration)
   - **Cube 8**: SolarPunk Compass

## Practical Applications

### Vertex Mapping Protocol
1. **Personal Reflection**: Use Compass to identify your natural vertex
2. **Community Inventory**: Map all community members to their vertices
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify which vertices are underrepresented
4. **Skill Development**: Create pathways for people to develop in needed vertices
5. **Project Design**: Ensure projects include team members from complementary vertices

### Face Scoring Protocol
1. **Hexagonal Mapping**: Draw hexagonal grid of the 24 faces
2. **Community Assessment**: Score each face 1-5 based on community strength
3. **Priority Identification**: Circle the 3 lowest-scoring faces
4. **Intervention Design**: Create projects that specifically strengthen weak faces
5. **Progress Tracking**: Reassess quarterly to track improvement

### Cube Activation Protocol
1. **Diagnosis**: Identify which folded cubes are most hardened in your community
2. **Boundary Medicine**: Design practices that specifically heal each cube
   - **Cube 5**: Body-based practices, material intelligence work
   - **Cube 6**: Dialogue training, community ceremony
   - **Cube 7**: Project design workshops, systems thinking
   - **Cube 8**: Compass work, meta-perspective practices
3. **Phase Alignment**: Match cube healing to current dialectical phase
4. **Integration**: Combine cube healing with vertex and face work

## Case Study: Urban Sustainability Collective
**Context**: Collective of 25 people working on neighborhood sustainability projects.

**Geometry Assessment**:
- **Vertices**: Strong in Making (Regenerative Ecologists) and Healing (Eco-Therapists), weak in Liberation (no Earth Jurisprudence Advocates)
- **Faces**: Low scores on POLITICS-HEALTH and ECONOMICS-BUILDINGS interfaces
- **Cubes**: Cube 6 (Intersubjective Gateway) most hardened due to past conflicts

**Interventions**:
1. Created mentorship program to develop Earth Jurisprudence Advocates
2. Launched project connecting health and policy through food sovereignty work
3. Designed "dialogue circles" using hexagonal seating to heal Cube 6

**Outcome**: Within 18 months, balanced vertex representation, 40% improvement in weak face scores, and successful policy change on urban agriculture.
