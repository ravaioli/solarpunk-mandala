# Appendix A: Four-Axis Contraction Tables

## Introduction
Contraction tables provide a diagnostic framework for identifying when communities are moving away from integration toward fragmentation. These tables map the symptoms of contraction across the four ethical axes (Soteriological, Axiological, Relational, Temporal) and connect them to their Rhizomatic expressions in the Circles of Sustainability and Ekistics elements.

## A.1 Soteriological Contraction (Self Integration)

| From → To | Interior Symptoms | Rhizomatic Indicator (Circles + Ekistics) |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 4D → 3D | "This is all there is." | Low Transcendence & Wonder (Spirituality) + Aesthetic Needs (MAN) |
| 3D → 2D | Identity narrows to roles | Low Identity & Engagement (Culture) + Cultural Pattern (SOCIETY) |
| 2D → 1D | Rigid/incoherent narrative | Low Meaning & Narrative (Spirituality) + Memory & Projection (Culture) |
| 1D → 0D | "I am my pain." | Low Safety Needs (MAN) + Security & Accord (Politics) |

## A.2 Axiological Contraction (System Regeneration)

| From → To | Systemic Symptoms | Rhizomatic Indicator |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 4D → 3D | Retreat to expert-led efficiency | Low Dialogue & Reconciliation (Politics) + Community Services (SHELLS) |
| 3D → 2D | Solidarity fractures | Low Cultural Pattern (SOCIETY) + Identity & Engagement (Culture) |
| 2D → 1D | "Progress = control" | Low Communication & Critique (Politics) + Communication Systems (NETWORKS) |
| 1D → 0D | Society as extraction node | Low Wealth & Distribution (Economics) + Soil Resources (NATURE) |

## A.3 Relational Depth Contraction (Connection Quality)

| From → To | Relational Symptoms | Rhizomatic Indicator |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Transpersonal → Communal | Loss of shared sacredness | Low Community & Ceremony (Spirituality) + Cultural Pattern (SOCIETY) |
| Communal → Relational | "My truth" vs. "your truth" | Low Dialogue & Reconciliation (Politics) + Enquiry & Learning (Culture) |
| Relational → Transactional | Relationships as exchange | Low Emotional Needs (MAN) + Wellbeing & Health (Culture) |

## A.4 Temporal Orientation Contraction (Time Wisdom)

| From → To | Temporal Symptoms | Rhizomatic Indicator |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Deep Time → Visionary | Future deferred for present | Low Memory & Projection (Culture) + Climate (NATURE) |
| Visionary → Historic | No shared future story | Low Beliefs & Ideas (Culture) + Cultural Pattern (SOCIETY) |
| Historic → Amnesic | Only next quarter matters | Low Memory & Projection (Culture) + Law & Administration (SOCIETY) |

## Practical Applications

### Step-by-Step Diagnosis Protocol
1. **Identify the Axis**: Determine which ethical axis is showing contraction symptoms
2. **Map the Rhizomatic Expression**: Locate the specific Circle and Ekistics elements showing weakness
3. **Assess Embodied Foundations**: Check which foundations (Nourishment, Cleansing, Restoration, Movement) are compromised
4. **Determine Dialectical Phase**: Assess whether the community is in 0D dissolution, 1D emergence, 2D integration, etc.
5. **Select Boundary Medicine**: Choose practices that specifically heal the identified dissociation

### Case Study: Urban Community Garden Network
**Context**: A network of community gardens was experiencing conflict and declining participation.

**Diagnosis**:
- **Axis**: Relational Depth contraction (Communal → Relational)
- **Rhizomatic Indicator**: Low Dialogue & Reconciliation (Politics) + Enquiry & Learning (Culture)
- **Foundation**: Movement (inability to move between garden sites safely)
- **Dialectical Phase**: 1D Emergence (trying to stabilize after rapid growth)

**Boundary Medicine Applied**:
- Created hexagonal walking paths between garden sites (Movement foundation)
- Established monthly "garden council" using talking piece protocol (Dialogue & Reconciliation)
- Developed shared learning journal for garden knowledge (Enquiry & Learning)

**Outcome**: Participation increased 40% within 6 months, with significant reduction in conflicts.
