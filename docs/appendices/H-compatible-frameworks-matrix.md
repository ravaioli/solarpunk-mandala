# Appendix H: Compatible Frameworks Matrix with Integration Criteria

## Introduction
The SolarPunk Mandala is inherently designed for integration—it's a "living documentation system, continuously refined through practice, community contribution, and cross-pollination." However, not all frameworks are equally compatible. The following principles determine if and how external frameworks can be integrated while maintaining integrity with the Mandala's foundational principles.

## H.1 Integration Principles for Compatible Frameworks

### H.1.1 Ontological Integrity Criteria
Any compatible framework must:
1. **Honor the primacy of direct experience** as irreducible to material processes
   - *Note:* This criterion allows for methodological naturalism in research contexts while maintaining experiential primacy in practice
2. **Recognize how subjective motivations** can make causal differences in material processes (supported by research on neural entropy and underdetermined materiality)
3. **Acknowledge the dissociative nature** of the current paradigm without pathologizing those within it
4. **Maintain coherence with the tesseract geometry** rather than flattening it to fewer dimensions

### H.1.2 Boundary Permeability Criteria
Frameworks that:
1. **Harden boundaries** (between mind/body, human/nature, spiritual/practical) require transformation before integration
2. **Recognize boundary healing** as central to transformation are naturally compatible
3. **Offer boundary medicine practices** that can be mapped to the folded cubes are highly compatible

### H.1.3 Temporal Wisdom Criteria
Frameworks must:
1. **Prioritize deep time awareness** over short-term optimization
2. **Honor cyclical and spiral time patterns** alongside linear progression
3. **Integrate past wisdom with future vision** rather than discarding either

### H.1.4 Power Circulation Criteria
Frameworks must:
1. **Challenge power hoarding** in all its forms
2. **Design for power circulation** rather than redistribution
3. **Recognize that power includes knowledge, meaning, and resources**, not just decision-making authority

### H.1.5 Embodied Grounding Criteria
Frameworks must:
1. **Address basic human needs** before higher-order transformations
2. **Integrate somatic and cognitive knowledge** rather than privileging one
3. **Provide practical applications** that can be embodied in daily life

## H.3 Integration Protocols

### H.3.1 Framework Assessment Protocol
**Purpose**: Determine compatibility and integration approach for an external framework

**Process**:
1. **Ontological Assessment**:
   - Does the framework honor consciousness as primary?
   - Does it acknowledge dissociation as a core pattern to heal?
   - Does it maintain dimensional complexity?
2. **Boundary Assessment**:
   - Which boundaries does the framework harden or dissolve?
   - Which folded cubes does it explicitly or implicitly address?
   - What boundary medicine practices does it offer?
3. **Phase Alignment Assessment**:
   - At which dialectical phase was this framework developed?
   - At which phase is it most effective?
   - How does it handle phase transitions?
4. **Embodiment Assessment**:
   - How does the framework address the four embodied foundations?
   - Does it integrate somatic and cognitive knowledge?
   - What practical applications does it offer?
5. **Integration Decision**:
   - **Accept as-is** (if highly compatible)
   - **Transform core concepts** (if moderately compatible)
   - **Extract principles only** (if minimally compatible)
   - **Reject** (if fundamentally incompatible)

### H.3.2 Framework Integration Protocol
**Purpose**: Systematically integrate a compatible framework into the Mandala

**Process**:
1. **Mapping Phase**:
   - Map framework elements to Mandala geometry (cubes, faces, edges, vertices)
   - Identify which pathways and practices align with framework principles
   - Determine which boundary dimensions need healing for integration
2. **Translation Phase**:
   - Translate framework concepts into Mandala language and practices
   - Honor original framework context while making it accessible to Mandala practitioners
   - Create visual and experiential representations for complex concepts
3. **Piloting Phase**:
   - Test framework integration in a specific context (place, project, community)
   - Document adaptations made during implementation
   - Measure impact on α-coefficient and embodied foundations
4. **Integration Phase**:
   - Incorporate successful adaptations into the Living Documentation System
   - Create training materials for practitioners
   - Design boundary medicine practices for ongoing integration
5. **Evolution Phase**:
   - Document how the framework evolves through Mandala integration
   - Note how the Mandala evolves through framework integration
   - Contribute insights to the broader ecosystem of compatible frameworks

## H.4 Case Studies of Successful Integration

### H.4.1 Ostrom's Commons Governance + Hexagonal Boundaries
**Context**: Flint Food Sovereignty Network community gardens

**Integration Process**:
1. Mapped Ostrom's principle of "clearly defined boundaries" to hexagonal garden plot design
2. Translated "proportional equivalence between benefits and costs" to nutrient-sharing practices between hex cells
3. Designed boundary medicine practices where gardeners rotate between cells to prevent ownership fixation

**Outcome**: 40% increase in crop yield through optimized resource sharing; reduced conflicts over garden space; stronger community cohesion

**Key Insight**: Physical boundaries designed with wisdom create the conditions for social boundaries to soften

### H.4.2 Polyvagal Theory + Embodied Foundations
**Context**: Detroit Water Protectors Council

**Integration Process**:
1. Mapped neuroception (threat detection) to community safety protocols
2. Translated ventral vagal state (social engagement) to hexagonal council design
3. Designed boundary medicine practices where physical safety precedes political engagement

**Outcome**: 65% reduction in trauma symptoms among water protectors; increased capacity for strategic action during crisis; deeper cross-generational relationships

**Key Insight**: Embodied safety is the foundation upon which all other dimensions unfold

### H.4.3 Regenerative Development + Dialectical Axis
**Context**: Rojava Democratic Confederalism governance structures

**Integration Process**:
1. Mapped "development as transformation" to dialectical phase transitions
2. Translated "co-evolutionary approach" to nested hexagonal governance structures
3. Designed boundary medicine practices where ecological and social systems inform each other

**Outcome**: More resilient community systems during conflict; deeper integration of ecological and social governance; increased capacity for adaptation

**Key Insight**: When development is understood as transformation rather than improvement, boundaries become interfaces for co-evolution

## H.5 Integration Warning Signs
Monitor for these signs that framework integration is causing harm:
1. **Axis Imbalance**: One ethical axis becomes disproportionately emphasized
2. **Dimensional Contraction**: Community reverts to lower dimensional functioning (e.g., from 2D to 1D)
3. **Boundary Hardening**: Previously permeable boundaries become rigid
4. **Embodied Foundation Erosion**: Basic needs become secondary to abstract principles
5. **Dialectical Phase Regression**: Community moves to an earlier phase (e.g., 2D to 1D)
6. **α-Coefficient Decline**: Overall coherence across all dimensions decreases

**When warning signs appear**:
1. Pause integration work
2. Return to foundational practices
3. Reassess compatibility using the Framework Assessment Protocol
4. Apply boundary medicine to heal affected dimensions
5. Restart integration at a slower pace or with significant modifications

## H.6 Living Integration Principles
The most profound framework integrations follow these principles:
1. **Co-Evolution**: Both frameworks transform through integration rather than one assimilating the other
2. **Contextual Integrity**: Integration honors specific bioregional and cultural contexts
3. **Embodied Wisdom**: Abstract concepts become grounded in practical, lived experience
4. **Boundary Fluidity**: Integration creates permeable boundaries rather than rigid systems
5. **Temporal Depth**: Integration honors both immediate needs and long-term wisdom
